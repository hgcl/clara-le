<h1>Bookmarks</h1>
<p class="intro">
  I use <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a> to bookmark links and
  annotate articles I read. Here is my extracted <em>Bookmarks</em> collection,
  which consists of both articles I wish to read—or listen to—and links I'd like
  to keep in my pocket for future reference.
