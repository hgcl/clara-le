    <h2>Life Under Control: My Planner Shop</h2>
    <p>
      End of 2018, I launched my planner shop
      <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/LifeUnderControl/">
        Life Under Control
      </a>
      while backpacking in South-East Asia. As of January 2021, the shop had
      +90k visits, +1,700 orders and a rating of 5/5 stars on average.

    <h2>The Berlin Walls: Street Art Walks in Berlin</h2>
    <p>
      When arriving in Berlin in 2018, Robin and I were amazed by how street art
      covered everything—walls, bridges and cars. From the big murals to the
      small stickers, we explored our first neighborhood through the urban art
      lens. A 50-page street art walking guide was born of it.

    <h2>Dynamic Landing Page</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a complete rework of the home and service pages of an SEO company
      website. They are both one-pagers that are optimized for client
      conversion—first presenting the problem, the solution and its benefits,
      before diving more into the features. Bonus: the animated illustrations
      also bring additional dynamism and clarity.

    <h2>Digital Illustrations</h2>
    <p>
      On the spectrum of digital illustration, I like experimenting with
      different tools and techniques. Here are some examples of illustrations
      made with Blender, Illustrator and Photoshop respectively.

    <h2>This website (going meta)</h2>
    <p>
      I have been learning to create static generated websites since end of
      2020. The website you are on right now was created from scratch using the
      <a href="https://brut.pages.dev/">static generator <em>brut</em></a
      >. All the remaining HTML, CSS and JS is handcrafted by yours truly. If
      you are interested,
      <a href="/posts/last-homage-to-my-old-website"
        >here is also a post about my previous website</a
      >
      that was written in React instead.
