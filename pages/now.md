Still trying to find my marks in this new countryside life. I spend my free time:

- Tending to the wood stove fire to heat the main living room
- Exploring the house
- Unpacking our boxes
- Planning and cooking meals
- Visiting neighbors and Robin's grandma for coffee (or wine)
- Reading graphic novels
- Thinking about post ideas for [Eau de poisson](https://eaudepoisson.com/)
