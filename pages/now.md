_Last updated on Feb 27, 2022_

I have now been in Berlin for more than two years—kinda crazy.

My routine mostly consists of bouldering a few times a week, meeting with friends for morning pastries, working almost full-time as a visual designer, nurturing my planner shop _[Life Under Control](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LifeUnderControl/)_ and watching _Doctor Who_.

A few current side-projects:

- Learning stop motion
- Creating my Interactive Fiction game
- Building my website from scratch with [brut](https://github.com/robinmetral/brut/)—yes, _again_
