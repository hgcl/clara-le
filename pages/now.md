I am based in Berlin since 3+ years and working as a UX designer. (And if everything goes to plan, soon moving to the countryside in France).

Outside of work, you'll find me bouldering[^1] religiously and sharing morning pastries with friends in any kind of weather.

A few side-projects:

- Going through a [wine tasting project](https://www.rafaeldelima.com/) with Robin consisting of trying 73 different wines.
- Learning about UX and updating [my UX living notes](/posts/ui-ux-learnings/) accordingly
- Nurturing my planner shop _[Life Under Control](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LifeUnderControl/)_
- Participating in my first D&D campaign. My character is a dragonborn who is on a personal cooking quest.
- Working on my own Figma wireframing library—because why not.
