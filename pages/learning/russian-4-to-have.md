"У _A_ есть _B_" ~ "By _A_ there is a _B_." which is used to translate "_A_ has a _B_."

The owner (A) is in the Genitive case, while the subject (B) is in the Nominative case.

Omit "есть" if the existence of the object is obvious or not the point. This is very typical for describing traits or a number of objects. This also applies when expressing temporary states and illnesses ("She has a migraine").
