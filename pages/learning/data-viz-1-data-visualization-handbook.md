It's been a while <cite>Data visualization handbook</cite> by Juuso Koponen and Jonatan Hild√©n has been waiting on my book shelf. I started to go through it about a week ago and here are a few quotes that stayed with me.

Notes before we start:

- The page numbers I use are from the first edition (2020).
- Some quotes might only be understandable within context.
