1. Cut through "the hat" of a pomegranate (at about a quarter from its tip), making sure not to cut through the seeds. Empty the had from its seeds and set aside in a bowl.
2. Get back to the fruit body and cut through its skin "vertically", just like when cutting an apple into quarters.
3. The fruit should open up when you gently press on it. Remove the membranes that are easily detachable.
4. Turn the fruit on its head (above the bowl) and hit on its back until all the seeds have fallen off.
