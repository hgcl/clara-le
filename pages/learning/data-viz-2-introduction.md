### Text v. data visualization

> When should data be visualized, and when is text enough? In short, if something can be expressed just as clearly or even more clearly in words, visualization is unnecessaryâ€”sometimes even couterproductive. (p. 29)

### Golden rule

> [There is] one rule that an information designer should always follow: choose the clearest presentation method available. Disregard any other rules and guidelines we present in this book, when they are in conflict with this golden rule of information design. (p. 43)

### Micro/macro reading

> At its best, a visualization gives an overview of the topic quickly, but also rewards the reader who spends time exploring it in depth. (p. 43)
