Yesterday, I tried making solid shampoo for the first time. Here is the rough recipe I followed.

Ingredients:

- 50 g SCI (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate)
- 15 g bhringaraj powder
- 17 g chaulmoogra oil
- 15 g rosmarin hydrolat
- Optional: 24 drops of essential oils (tea tree, lavender, lemon)

The list of ingredients looks more dauting than it really is, as most of these ingredients can be swapped to other alternatives (e.g. choose your own powder, oil, water-based solution, and essential oils).

For instance, a super simple recipe (not tested though) would be something like SCI + a powder + coconut oil + water.

### Note about the SCI

Apparently, using solid shampoo only can be irritating for your scalp (because of the SCI). It is usually recommended to alternate with a liquid shampoo â€” which doesn't need SCI to keep it solid.

SCI is also [not very ecologically friendly to produce](https://blutopia.org/shampoing-solide-sci/). I will probably look into making some liquid shampoo as well in the future.

### Observations and potential improvements

- So easy to make! Basically: mix everything in a _bain-marie_ and knead your mixture by hand with the essential oils.
- Too many essential oil drops; I would bring it down to max 20 drops.
- Would mixing only the SCI with the oil first help to melt it completely? Using a solid spoon could help to break it down as well.
