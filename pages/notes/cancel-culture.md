excerpt: "Closely linked to deplatforming, censorship and virtue signalling. Cancelling is about intimidating ideological opponents."
---

_Canceling_ is different from _criticism_ in that its practitioners seek <q>to organize and manipulate the social or media environment in order to isolate, deplatform or intimidate ideological opponents. [Cancel culture] is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity and reduce the scope for forms of criticism that are not sanctioned by the prevailing consensus of some local majority.</q>[^1]

In his article, Rauch differentiates cancel culture from criticism in six ways[^2]:

1. Punitiveness — A critical culture seeks to correct rather than punish. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to punish rather than correct—and often for a single misstep rather than a long track record of failure. You are denounced to your employer, social connections, you are blacklisted and socially isolated.
2. Deplatforming — A critical culture tolerates dissent rather than silencing it. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to shut up and shout down its targets. Cancelers often define the mere act of disagreeing with them as a threat to their safety or even an act of violence.
3. Organization — Critical culture relies on persuasion. The way to win an argument is to convince others that you are right. Organizing pressure campaigns against political or ideological targets is usually considered out of bounds. By contrast, it's common to see cancelers organize hundreds of petition-signers or thousands of social media users to dig up and prosecute an indictment.
4. Secondary boycotts — Is there an explicit or implicit threat that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you are receiving? With its commitments to exploring a wide range of ideas and correcting rather than coercing the errant, a critical culture sees no value in instilling a climate of fear. But instilling fear is what canceling is all about.
5. [Moral grandstanding](/notes/virtue-signalling) — Is the tone of the discourse _[ad hominem](/notes/ad-hominem)_[^3], repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged? Are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one-upmanship? Precisely because speech can be hurtful, critical culture discourages extreme rhetoric. It encourages people to listen to each other, to use evidence and argumentation, to behave reasonably and to avoid personal attacks.
6. Truthiness — Are the things being said about you inaccurate? Do they feel at liberty to distort your words, ignore corrections and make false accusations?[^4] Concern for accuracy is the north star of a critical culture.
