I first heard of the term through Tara Mooknee's video essay[^1]. In her essay, she quotes Bartholomew who described the concept of _virtue signalling_ pretty well[^2].

> No one actually has to do anything. Virtue comes from mere words or even from silently held beliefs. There was a time in the distant past when people thought you could only be virtuous by doing things: by helping the blind man across the road; looking after your elderly parents instead of dumping them in a home; staying in a not-wholly-perfect marriage for the sake of the children. These things involve effort and self-sacrifice. That sounds hard! Much more convenient to achieve virtue by expressing hatred of those who think the health service could be improved by introducing competition. [...] Twitter lends itself very well to virtue signalling, since it is much easier to express anger and scorn in 140 characters than to make a reasoned argument.[^3]

In my eyes, one of the main issues of virtue signalling is when it wears the more aggressive [woke shaming](/notes/woke-shaming) hat.

In her essay, Mooknee introduces another interesting concept: [vice signalling](/notes/vice-signalling).
