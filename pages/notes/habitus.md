In Bourdieu's words, _habitus_ refers to "a subjective but not individual system of internalized structures, schemes of perception, conception, and action common to all members of the same group or class"[^]Pierre Bourdieu, _Outline of a Theory of Practice_, 1977.[^^].

I first discovered this concept via this video essay explaining the [Overton Window](overton-window) and _Why AOC's dress matters_[^]Alice Cappelle, _[Why AOC's dress matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hax6xSScQdA)_, 2021, Video.[^^].
