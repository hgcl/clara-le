excerpt: "Rather than treating working people as an agency for change or a constituency to be served, they publicly declared them a problem to be solved, and explained racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry as the consequence of the public's lamentable ignorance."

Jeff Sparrow on smug politics[^1]:

> [T]he rise of Donald Trump [can be explained] by looking at the resonance of his attacks on so-called political correctness. [..] Trump capitalised on the evolution of the Left. The social movements of the 1960s built via a ‘direct politics' that identified grassroots mobilisations of working people as the antidote to racism, sexism and other forms of oppression. The anti-war struggle; anti-racism campaigns; women's liberation; gay liberation and so on: they shared (in the broadest sense) a belief that change depended on the masses overcoming oppressive structures imposed on them by the wealthy and powerful.
>
> By the mid-seventies, as struggles declined, direct politics increasingly gave way to a 'delegated politics' in which white collar intellectuals in various positions of power (say, in universities, NGOs or the public service) worked for a social change that no longer depended on mobilising the population but rather delivered outcomes on their behalf by deploying the state or semi-state institutions.

> In the 2000s, many progressives went one step further by embracing what I call 'smug politics': rather than treating working people as an agency for change or a constituency to be served, they publicly declared them a problem to be solved, and explained racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry as the consequence of the public's lamentable ignorance. ‘Left-wing' celebrities, writers and academics presented ordinary people as dangerous buffoons who needed to be compelled, by whatever means necessary, to abandon their backwardness.
