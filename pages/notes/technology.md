Technology used to be a lot more than just the computing and digital world. Writing is a technology.

Dan Wang explains that technology can take three forms: tools, instructions and process knowledge.

- Tools are simply pots, screwdrivers and phones for instance. They are objects that can be used.
- Instructions can be explained. With the kitchen analogy, instructions would be recipes.
- [Process knowledge](/notes/process-knowledge) is the know-how. It is the tacit knowledge, the technical experience that is built with time.
