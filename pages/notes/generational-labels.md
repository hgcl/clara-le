In his article[^1], Joe Pinsker summaries the points made by sociologist Philip Cohen.

First of all, labels are imprecise and inaccurate as they <q>steer every conversation toward generalization, fairly or not</q>.

> Generational labels capture some of the basic fact that people who are born in different eras lead meaningfully different lives. But these labels are clumsy and imprecise—and getting more so all the time. They flatten out the experiences of tens of millions of very different people, remove nuance from conversations, and imply commonality where there may be none. [...]
>
> Baby Boomers are the only currently living cohort defined by an actual demographic event—in this case, the postwar baby boom. [...] The Silent Generation was born over a span of 18 years before the end of World War II; Millennials entered the world over a span of 16 years from 1981 to 1996. No official body certified these categories and verified the rationale behind them—they just eventually became accepted after getting repeated over and over.

It feels like labels only serve to stereotype and mock imaginary monoliths in a generational warfare. It is especially easy to do as our communities are getting more [segregated by age](/notes/age-segregation) than ever before.

Down the line, generational labels are just another selling tool for marketers who need easy targeting—no matter if the method is accurate or not.

> Consultants and marketing experts take advantage of the appetite for these sorts of narratives by framing generations monolithically and presenting themselves to clients as authorities on entire segments of the population.
