## What's in a virus?[^1]

Viruses are made of two things:

- genetic material (DNA or RNA)
- proteins

The genetic material serves as a "blueprint" to make the proteins. But what are the proteins for? There are different types of proteins:

- Some proteins surround the genetic material and form the structure of the virus.
- Other proteins help the virus survive and make more copies of itself.

For instance, the _receptor protein_ is "spikey" and enables the virus to attach itself to cells in our body.

Once attached, viruses can insert their genetic material into our cells. Their genetic material takes over our own protein-making machinery. It makes copies of its own genetic material and builds its own proteins. It even uses our own cells to assemble more viruses!

## Our immune system

Two major types of cells recognize diseases in our immune system, flush them out, and build 'memory' for our immunity against later invasions: _B cells_ and _T cells_. These adaptive immune cell types can work independently or together to fight infection and build memory against re-exposure towards the invader (e.g., the virus, bacterium, parasite, cancer cell, etc.).

T cells have the ability to kill these invaders directly, recruit other immune system cells to the site of infection, and aid in the development of B cells. They are also able to confer memory through the release of proteins called cytokines.

B cells release proteins called antibodies[^2], which similarly recognize invaders and work to destroy them. When something foreign enters our bodies, B cells begin to create antibodies against that invader. While these cells are amazing at protecting our bodies from infection, this process takes time (about 7 days for the adaptive immune system).

However, once our immune system is 'primed' with a particular invader, it can produce antibodies against this invader very quickly when exposed to it again, preventing re-infection. The use of vaccines gives our immune system (including our B and T cells) a template to develop immune memory against re-infection without experiencing the full onset of symptoms viral exposure generates.

## How do vaccines work?

So, how do vaccines coax our immune system into providing a defense against viral infections? There are many different vaccine types, but they all use parts of the virus to trick our immune system into creating antibodies against that virus, effectively 'priming' our immune system to be ready to quickly generate antibodies when we are exposed to the real virus. As you can imagine, there are many different parts of a virus to choose from when creating vaccines, and some viruses are more difficult to develop a vaccine against than others. Viruses such as the flu can mutate rapidly, which is why we need a new flu shot each year to protect us from the most prevalent flu strain. In fact, many RNA viruses can mutate quickly, creating new strains that may need a different vaccine to be effective. Coronaviruses, such as COVID-19, are RNA viruses (read more about the novel coronavirus here).

## Different types of vaccines

Scientists can make vaccines from whole viruses or parts of viruses. These include[^1]:

- Inactivated Viruses: It still has its proteins, but its genetic material can no longer make more viruses.
- Attenuated Viruses: These vaccines use viruses that are still alive, but have been changed so that they cannot make you seriously ill.
- Subunits: Scientists produce a protein specific to a virus rather than using the entire virus.
- Vector-based Vaccines: Scientists use a piece of genetic material from the virus of interest. They then “cut and paste” it into a safe virus that can't make you sick.
- DNA: Scientists remove specific genetic sequences from the DNA of a virus. They then place it into a 'delivery system' called a plasmid. Cells that take up the DNA plasmid will use their own protein-making machinery to produce a particular viral protein.
- mRNA: Scientists package the mRNA inside a special delivery system called LPNs[^3] that protect the mRNA vaccine from being destroyed before it's delivered to cells.
