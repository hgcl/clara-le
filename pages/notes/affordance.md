Don Norman, early user experience designer at Apple and author of _The Design of Everyday Things_ became famous for his inability to open doors.

> Yes. I push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be pushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. Moreover, I see others having the same troublesâ€” unnecessary troubles. My problems with doors have become so well known that confusing doors are often called "Norman doors".
