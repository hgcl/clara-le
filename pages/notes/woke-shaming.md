I have to agree with Obama's point of view on the issue: "The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws."[^]Allyson Chiu, _[He is right on all counts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/31/obama-woke-shaming-bipartisan-support-yang-coulter-gabbard/)_, Washington Post, 2019.[^^]

In today's moral landscape, it is hard to have a conversation about politics, philosophy or ethics without having to add a disclaimer to each and every sentence. Woke shaming fosters a very unwelcoming and intolerant environment, where it is impossible to disagree—even slightly—with the in-group. Not being able to disagree with "your team" seems like a sign of radicalization.
