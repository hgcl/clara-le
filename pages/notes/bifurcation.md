When talking about career paths, bifurcating is a term created by Maloney in his article _Don't quit your day job_ (2015)[^]Thomas Maloney, _[Don't quit your day job](https://aeon.co/essays/dont-quit-your-day-job-the-benefits-of-being-a-bifurcator)_, 2015.[^^].

Bifurcating is the act of dividing your time between a stable job and a side activity—that you would rather pursue as a main career.

Bifurcating is a compromise between the more stable "having a family and some savings" world and the riskier "following your passion" choice.

## Is It Bad to Bifurcate?

> I wouldn't dare to advise young idealists either to follow or not to follow their dreams. At the most, I might advise them to be wary of career preachers, whether radical or conservative, and that, while they shouldn't fear commitment and leaps of faith, they also shouldn't fear compromise.[^]Thomas Maloney, _[Don't quit your day job](https://aeon.co/essays/dont-quit-your-day-job-the-benefits-of-being-a-bifurcator)_, 2015.[^^]

It is completely fine to not know where you are going, to be in the in-between. "Simply follow your passion" preachers might be as toxic as their too conservative counterparts.
