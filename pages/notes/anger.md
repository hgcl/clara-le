excerpt: "Can anger be constructive and transformative?"
---

Ancient Stoic philosopher Seneca said, <q>To be angry is to be a madman</q>.

Philosophy scholar Myisha Cherry argues that our view of anger might be over-simplified[^1]:

> I reject the notion that any and all instances of anger are always backward-looking, always static, always seeking revenge, and therefore that anger has no place. I reject it just as I reject the idea that what we call love is always beautiful, always feels good, is always what we need. I'm not persuaded by that.

Cherry explains that there are different types of angers. Some are destructive, while others are constructive. She differentiates Loredean rage from narcissistic rage (you're angry that _you_ were the victim of injustice) and rogue rage (seeking revenge because of an injustice).

Quoting her on the different types of rage:

> Unlike the rogue or narcissistic kinds, Lordean rage is not only concerned about how you can be a victim of injustice, it's also concerned about how anyone could be a victim of injustice. So it's very much inclusive; it's not self-centered. [...] [It] is very much focussed on what we can do to make things better. If it destroys anything, it's going to destroy the patriarchy; it's going to destroy racist structures. But it's not trying to defeat people, or humiliate people. It's very focussed on transformation.
