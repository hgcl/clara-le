  <h1>Blogroll</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Before search engines became a thing, blogrolls were quite common. Everyone
    would have a section on their websites dedicated to sharing links they
    liked. I just love this idea of subjective and personal curation, leading
    you from website to website.
