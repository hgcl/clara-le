    <h1>Blogroll</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Before search engines became a thing, blogrolls were quite common.
      Everyone would have a section on their website dedicated to sharing links
      they liked. I just love this idea of subjective and personal curation,
      leading you from website to website.

      Open a random link

<script>
  const el = document.getElementById("random-link");
  el.addEventListener("click", (el) => {
    // get a random number between 0 and the number of links
    let randIdx = Math.random() * linkArray.length;
    // round it, so it can be used as array index
    randIdx = parseInt(randIdx, 10);
    // construct the link to be opened
    let randomLink = linkArray[randIdx];
    // open it in a new window / tab (depends on browser setting)
    window.open(randomLink);
  });
</script>
