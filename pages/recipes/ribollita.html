  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place the (unsoaked) dried beans in the smaller pot with 4 cups of cold
      water and just ½ teaspoon of salt. Turn on the heat to medium and bring to
      a gentle boil, then turn down the heat to the lowest setting and cover
      with a lid. Keep simmering until cooked (between 3h and 3h30 in my
      experience). Otherwise use soaked beans and cook them in the same amount
      of water, until done (cooking time will be quicker).
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, chop the carrot, onion, and celery. Mince the garlic. Peel and
      dice the potatoes, clean and cut the remaining vegetables into ½-inch
      slices or cubes. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the beans are cooked, drain them, reserving the cooking water. In a
      blender or food processor, puree about ¾ of the beans and return the bean
      purée to the cooking water. Set aside. Also set aside the remaining whole
      beans.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large pot, prepare the soffritto: heat 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive
      oil, and sauté the carrot, celery, garlic and onion over medium-high heat,
      until golden in color, about 7-8 minutes. Stir often to avoid burning.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the thyme leaves, the remaining 1/2 tsp. of salt, the remaining fresh
      vegetables, the tomato paste, the bean purée with its water, along with an
      additional 4 cups of water. Cook over low heat, covered, for about 1 hour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, add the previously cooked whole beans and the stale bread, cut
      into ½-inch slices, crust on. Stir, cook for another 5 minutes and turn
      off the heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let soup sit for at least a few hours, ideally overnight. Then, reheat the
      soup, boiling for a few minutes at low heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper and drizzled with a
      little high-quality extra-virgin olive oil.
    </li>
  </ol>
