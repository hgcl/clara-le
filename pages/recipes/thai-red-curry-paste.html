  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Toast whole chilis for 5 minutes on low heat to dry them and make them more easily grindable.
    </li>
    <li>
      Toast coriander, peppercorns and cumin in a pan until light brown. You'll hear the crackling sound when they're
      ready. It should take a few minutes. Let the spices cool so they will grind easily.
    </li>
    <li>
      Slice shallots, lemongrass, galangal and cilantro roots into small pieces. I use one lemongrass stalk. Slice
      thinly or grate the kaffir lime zest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Grind the spices (cumin, coriander and peppercorns) into powder. Scoop out and set the ground spices aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add dried whole chili peppers and salt. Grind until the chili peppers turn into powder.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add lemongrass and galangal into the mortar. Grind them into rough fibers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add garlic, kaffir lime zest and cilantro roots.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you can no longer recognize the individual ingredients, add the shallots and grind them as well.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Storage: You can store the curry paste in the freezer for at least one year. I put my curry paste in a freezer bag
    and flatten the paste to get rid of the air. Once when the flattened paste is frozen, it can be easily broken off
    into smaller pieces.</p>
  <p>Note: The role of salt in curry pastes is to help with grinding and to act as a preservative.</p>
