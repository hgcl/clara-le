  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cream the butter, sugar and crushed Earl Grey leaves together.</li>
    <li>
      Add the rest of the ingredients—flour, vanilla seeds, sea salt—and mix
      until everything forms a ball of dough. It might take a while.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once it has formed, turn the dough out onto the work surface. Divide into
      two pieces and shape each one into a rectangular log.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optional: mix the sumac and sugar on the work surface. Roll the log in the
      sumac-sugar to coat it all over.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the logs in the fridge to set for at least 1 hour (or freeze it
      until you want to bake).
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat your oven to 190&nbsp;°C (or 170&nbsp;°CC with fan). Line two baking
      trays with baking paper. Use a sharp knife to cut each log into 14–20
      slices of less than 1 cm each.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 10–15 minutes until light golden, then remove from the oven. Be
      careful, as the shortbreads will still be very soft and crumbly—I learned
      the hard way.
    </li>
    <li>Leave to cool on the tray before eating.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Tip: If your butter is not at room temperature, put it in the oven at
    30&nbsp;°C for 10 minutes.
