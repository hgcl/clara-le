  "intro": "This is a recipe that Niamh recommended to me. And as with most dessert recipes, she was spot on. Definitely one of the best banana breads I have eaten. It has a very strong banana taste, is moist in the inside, but crispy on the outside.",

        "Heat oven to 150&nbsp;℃. Line a 20&nbsp;cm loaf tin.",
        "Melt butter in a large pan. Whisk in brown sugar until smooth, then stir in 3 mashed bananas. Whisk in eggs, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda (Natron), and sourdough starter (or baking powder). Whisk until the ingredients are fully dispersed in the batter.",
        "Add flour and stir until combined, add the chopped walnuts and the rest of the bananas (sliced). Scrape batter into prepared loaf tin.",
        "Bake banana bread for 75 minutes, or more. Test with a knife—the top third is often slowest to cook. The bread will get very dark but will not taste burnt.",
        "Let cool in pan. This banana bread is good on the first day but exceptional on the second and third."
