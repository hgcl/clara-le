        "With the mandolin or chef's knife, chop the cabbage (keep 1 outer cabbage leaf) and place in a bowl. Add salt, caraway, pepper and all other spices.",
        "Massage the vegetables with your hands for a few minutes, until the cabbage is as much disgorged as possible.",
        "Transfer to a glass jar or a fermentation jar in small quantities, by squeezing the cabbage each time by hand or using a tamper. The liquid produced should submerge the cabbage. Add pre-boiled water to cover the cabbage if necessary.",
        "Place the whole cabbage leaf on top of the mixture to prevent the minced cabbage from coming in contact with the air. Add a weight on this cabbage leaf as needed.",
        "Close the jar while allowing the air to exit.",
        "Let it stand away from direct light for a week. Store it in the fridge when sour enough.",
        "Remove the weight and discard the pieces of cabbage that float on the surface, if any. Taste the sauerkraut, which should be tangy."
