  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Heat ¼ cup oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add
      walnuts and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring often, until nuts are
      deeply golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and grate in
      whole garlic clove; set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wipe out pot. Combine ¼ cup oil and remaining sliced garlic in pot and
      cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until oil around garlic
      is bubbling vigorously and garlic is beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.
      Firmly crush rosemary in your hand to bruise; add to pot along with beans
      and stir to coat. Increase heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally,
      until beans are just beginning to take on color, about 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring
      occasionally, until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package
      directions.
    </li>
    <li>
      When pasta is about 4 minutes away from being done, transfer 1 cup pasta
      cooking liquid to pot with beans (make sure to keep heat on medium so that
      the liquid doesn’t evaporate too quickly). Using a wooden spoon, gently
      mash about three-quarters of beans into a creamy sauce.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer pasta to pot with beans and add
      1 cup pasta cooking liquid and 2 Tbsp. oil; mix well to combine. Increase
      heat to medium-high, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring gently with a
      heatproof rubber spatula, until sauce coats pasta, about 2 minutes. (Sauce
      might look soupy but will thicken as it sits so don't worry!) Finely grate
      in about one-quarter of zest from lemon, then cut lemon in half. Squeeze
      in juice from 1 lemon half and add parsley; mix well to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Divide pasta among bowls. Drizzle with oil, season with black pepper, and
      top with reserved nut mixture. Slice remaining lemon half into wedges and
      serve alongside for squeezing over.
    </li>
