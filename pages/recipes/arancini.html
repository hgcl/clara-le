    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Shape your rice balls, filling them if you want to.
      </li>
      <li>When all of your arancini have been formed, whisk together the flour, eggs, 1/2 cup of water, and a pinch of
        salt in a shallow bowl until smooth.</li>
      <li>Spread the breadcrumbs in a plate or baking dish.</li>
      <li>Gently roll each ball first in the egg-flour-water-salt mixture, letting any excess drip off.</li>
      <li>Then roll them in the breadcrumbs until evenly coated.</li>
      <li>At this point, you can refrigerate your arancini for 20 to 30 minutes to let them firm up if they seem a bit
        too loose or liquidy. If not, you can go directly to frying.</li>
      <li>Heat about 5&nbsp;cm of neutral frying oil to 180&nbsp;Â°C.</li>
      <li>Fry your arancini in batches of just 2 to 3 at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pot until they are
        evenly golden brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Transfer them to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
    </ol>
