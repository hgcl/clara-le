  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Diced the cold butter into the flour with a knife or dough scraper. Continue until the mixture looks crumbly and
      the butter pieces are around the size of peas.
    </li>
    <li>Make a well in the middle and pour in the ice cold water. Work it gradually until the mixture comes together
      into a ball.</li>
    <li>Turn the dough over a floured surface and shape it into a square. Roll out the dough into a rectangle that is
      twice as long as it is wide.</li>
    <li>Fold it in at each third lengthwiseâ€”like a letter.</li>
    <li>Rotate it 90 degrees and repeat the last two steps.</li>
    <li>Cover the dough so that it doesn't dry and cool it in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Repeat the rolling-folding-cooling steps twice more. For the last cooling phase, let the dough rest in the
      fridge for at least one hour before use.</li>
  </ol>
