        "Diced the cold butter into the flour with a knife or dough scraper. Continue until the mixture looks crumbly and the butter pieces are around the size of peas.",
        "Make a well in the middle and pour in the ice cold water. Work it gradually until the mixture comes together into a ball.",
        "Turn the dough over a floured surface and shape it into a square. Roll out the dough into a rectangle that is twice as long as it is wide.",
        "Fold it in at each third lengthwise â€” like a letter.",
        "Rotate it 90 degrees and repeat the last two steps.",
        "Cover the dough so that it doesn't dry and cool it in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
        "Repeat the rolling-folding-cooling steps twice more. For the last cooling phase, let the dough rest in the fridge for at least one hour before use."
