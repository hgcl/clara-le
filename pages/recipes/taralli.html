  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour over the oil in a thin stream while stirring. Do the same with
      the wine—stir until absorbed.</li>
    <li> Transfer the dough to a floured working surface and knead for 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic—it should
      bounce back when lightly pressed.</li>
    <li>Take a small piece of dough—the size of a large olive—and roll it out to a rope about 0.5&nbsp;cm thick. Join
      the ends—press lightly so they stick together—to form a circle. Transfer on a wooden board or non-stick surface.
      Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop a small batch of tarallini in the water and wait until they come back
      to the surface. Drain them with a slotted spoon and ease them on a tray covered with a kitchen towel. Repeat with
      the rest.</li>
    <li> Preheat the oven to 190&nbsp;°C. Arrange the tarallini on two baking sheets lined with parchment. Bake them for
      about 40 minutes, or until deeply golden.
    </li>
    <li>Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely. Store them in an airtight container.</li>
  </ol>
