        "Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour over the oil in a thin stream while stirring. Do the same with the wine—stir until absorbed.",
        "Transfer the dough to a floured working surface and knead for 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic—it should bounce back when lightly pressed.",
        "Take a small piece of dough—the size of a large olive—and roll it out to a rope about 0.5&nbsp;cm thick. Join the ends—press lightly so they stick together—to form a circle. Transfer on a wooden board or non-stick surface. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
        "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop a small batch of tarallini in the water and wait until they come back to the surface. Drain them with a slotted spoon and ease them on a tray covered with a kitchen towel. Repeat with the rest.",
        "Preheat the oven to 190&nbsp;°C. Arrange the tarallini on two baking sheets lined with parchment. Bake them for about 40 minutes, or until deeply golden.",
        "Remove them from the oven and let them cool completely. Store them in an airtight container."
