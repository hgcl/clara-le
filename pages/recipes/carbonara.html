<p class="intro">Matteo and Valentina introduced Robin and I to an authentic carbonara recipe. It is apparently only one
  of many subtle variations, as they argued over many details during the cooking process. Just loved learning it with a
  glass of red wine!

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the guanciale into strips of 0.5 x 5 cm.</li>
      <li>Combine the egg yolks with the grated cheese and a pinch of black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Brown the strips of guanciale for 2 minutes in a pan, until crisp, then turn off the heat and leave to cool.
      </li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt. Cook the pasta, setting aside a ladleful of the pasta cooking
        water, until al dente. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the reserved hot water into the frying pan with the cooled guanciale, then transfer the pasta to the same
        pan and mix together. Add the yolk and cheese mixture, stirring rapidly.
      </li>
      <li>In the warm pan with the hot pasta, the eggs will cook gently and become creamyâ€”don't stir over heat otherwise
        the carbonara will become lumpy. It's important to stir quickly to prevent the yolks from congealing and taking
        on
        the texture of scrambled eggs.
      </li>
      <li>Season with freshly milled black pepper and serve immediately on heated plates.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with some more grated Pecorino on top.</li>
    </ol>
