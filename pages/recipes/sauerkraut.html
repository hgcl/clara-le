  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      With the mandolin or chef's knife, chop the cabbage (keep 1 outer cabbage
      leaf) and place in a bowl. Add salt, caraway, pepper and all other spices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Massage the vegetables with your hands for a few minutes, until the
      cabbage is as much disgorged as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer to a glass jar or a fermentation jar in small quantities, by
      squeezing the cabbage each time by hand or using a tamper. The liquid
      produced should submerge the cabbage. Add pre-boiled water to cover the
      cabbage if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the whole cabbage leaf on top of the mixture to prevent the minced
      cabbage from coming in contact with the air. Add a weight on this cabbage
      leaf as needed.
    </li>
    <li>Close the jar while allowing the air to exit.</li>
    <li>
      Let it stand away from direct light for a week. Store it in the fridge
      when sour enough.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the weight and discard the pieces of cabbage that float on the
      surface, if any. Taste the sauerkraut, which should be tangy.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Tip: It can be stored for up to a year in the refrigerator.</p>
