  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Set a pot of water on medium-high heat to boil.</li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, peel the potatoes, slice them into roughly 1&nbsp;cm thick
      fries (or your desired fry size). Preheat the oven to 230&nbsp;°C.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the water has boiled, add the vinegar and a 3 finger pinch of salt,
      stirring to dissolve the salt. Add the potatoes to the boiling water and
      set a timer for 8 minutes. When the time is up, pour the fries into a
      colander and let the excess steam evaporate for a couple of minutes.
      <em
        >Note: The vinegar will slow down the breakdown of pectin so the fries
        do not fall apart as easily. However, they should look like they are
        almost falling apart, boil them longer if necessary.</em
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the fries to a large baking sheet and pour over the peanut oil. Mix
      the fries so the oil completely coats the outside of each fry. There
      should be a thin layer of excess oil on the pan. Add the pan to oven and
      set a timer for 15 minutes.
      <em
        >Note: Peanut oil has a higher % of saturated fat meaning it will crisp
        food more efficiently than oils with a lower % of saturated fat like
        olive or canola.</em
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Pull the baking sheet out and flip them over with a spatula. At this
      point, you should be able to see some blistering on the outside but the
      fries won't be overly crisp. If they look a little dry, drizzle over more
      peanut oil. Add them back to the oven and bake for another 15–20 minutes.
      At this point, they should be slightly browned and crispy though it could
      take longer depending on the size of the fry, how crowded the pan is or
      the oil used. If they aren't crispy, let them go longer!
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a paper towel in a bowl. Pour in the fries and immediately a pinch of
      salt. Toss the fries with the paper towel so it absorbs the excess oil.
      <em
        >Note: Feel free to add spices, fresh herbs, cheeses, or any flavorings
        of your choice during this stage. Serve and enjoy.</em
