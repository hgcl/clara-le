    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt the butter, then allow it to cool so that it is no longer hot, but is
        still liquid. I usually melt the butter first, then place it in the
        freezer while I'm working on everything else.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 160&nbsp;°C. Line a 20 x 20 cm pan with parchment paper so
        that the paper is coming up over the sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the eggs and sugar to a big bowl and beat until the mixture is light
        yellow and thick, about 5–7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Mix in the vanilla until just combined.</li>
      <li>
        In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the dried ingredients: the flour,
        cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly mix the dried flour mixture into the egg mixture until just
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, still on low speed, slowly pour in cooled butter until just
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>Spread evenly in prepared baking pan.</li>
      <li>
        Bake for 30–32 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into center of pan
        comes out with just a few crumbs. Do not over bake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to cool in pan for 2 minutes, then use parchment paper to lift
        brownies out of pan and let cool on rack.
      </li>
    </ol>
