        "Preheat a cast iron for 5 min on medium high. Add a tiny bit of cooking oil, once it is shimmering add the eggplant and cook for 3-5 min until golden and flip, cook for 1 min, make sure they don’t burn. You might need to fry them in 2–3 batches.",

        "Drizzle the sauce on top of the eggplant, top it with herbs, walnuts, black pepper and more salt if needed."
