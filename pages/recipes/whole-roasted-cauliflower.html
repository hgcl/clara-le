  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Place 1 head of cauliflower, stem side up, in the pot and bring to
      a boil. Cook until just tender, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, stem side down, and repeat
      with second head of cauliflower. Let cauliflower sit for 10 minutes and drain any liquid that has accumulated in
      the baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 190&nbsp;Â°C.
    </li>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine the butter and olive oil. Spread the mixture over the top of the cauliflower and
      sprinkle with salt.</li>
    <li>Bake for 1.5 hour, basting every 15 minutes, or until cauliflower is caramelized and fork tender.
      Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
  </ol>
