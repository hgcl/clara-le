My favorite Wes Anderson movie.

> Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965, Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two twelve-year-olds who fall in love, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness. As various authorities try to hunt them down, a violent storm is brewing off-shore â€“ and the peaceful island community is turned upside down in more ways than anyone can handle.
