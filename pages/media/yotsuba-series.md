Wholesome and hilarious.

> Yotsuba&! is centered on Yotsuba Koiwai, a five-year-old girl who is energetic, cheerful, curious, odd, and quirky—so much so that even her own father calls her unusual. She is also initially ignorant about many things that a child her age would be expected to know—among them doorbells, escalators, air conditioners, and even playground swings. This naïveté is the premise of humorous stories whereby which she learns about—and frequently misunderstands—everyday things.
