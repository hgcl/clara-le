    Hi, I'm Clara,
    <button type="button" id="word-swap" onclick="swapWord()">
      a tinkerer
    </button>
    based in the Ardèche region in France. I am currently trying to figure out
    the countryside life, as well as life in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to know more about what I'm up to at the moment, have a look at
    my
    <a href="/now/">Now page</a>, my latest
    <a href="/posts/?q=update">updates</a> or my
    <a href="/learning/">Learning Log</a>. You can peek behind the curtain of
    this website—oh exciting—by going to the
    <a href="/colophon">Colophon page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I consider this website to be a space where I can express myself freely in
    English, French and Frenglish without editing. If you happen to browse
    around here, you might find one-line notes, half-formed thoughts, doodles,
    full reviews or anything else in between.
  </p>
  <h2 id="contact">Get in touch</h2>
  <p>
    For those wanting to contact me: my Ouija board connection is unfortunately
    out of order, so you'll have to email me at
    <span class="highlight">hey [at] clarale [dot] com</span>.
