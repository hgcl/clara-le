  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Clara,
    <button id="word-swap" onclick="swapWord()">a tinkerer</button> based in the
    Ard√®che region in France. I am currently working remotely as a UX designer
    and trying to figure out the countryside life.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to know more about what I'm up to at the moment, have a look at
    my
    <a href="/now/">Now page</a> or one of my latest
    <a href="/posts/">weeknotes</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I consider this website to be a space where I can express myself freely
    without editing. If you happen to browse it a bit, you might find one-line
    notes, half-formed thoughts, doodles, full reviews or anything else in
    between.

  function swapWord() {
    let word = document.getElementById("word-swap");
    const wordArray = [
      "a tinkerer",
      "a designer",
      "an explorer",
      "a climber",
      "a cat lover",
      "a clumsy being",
      "a fixer",
    ];

    if (wordArray.includes(word.innerHTML) == true) {
      const index = wordArray.indexOf(word.innerHTML);
      wordArray[index + 1]
        ? (word.innerHTML = wordArray[index + 1])
        : (word.innerHTML = "a tinkerer");
    } else {
      word.innerHTML = "a tinkerer";
    }
