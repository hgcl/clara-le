It's the last day of 2022, 5.40 AM, and I can't seem to sleep anymore. A lot of thoughts are going through my mind. Most of them relate to our [move to France](/posts/city-kids-going-cottagecore/) in less than a month. I won't dive into the list of logistical to-dos that is keeping me awake. I'll go the other way around and take a snapshot in time. A snapshot of our time spent in Berlin and the things I'll miss from here.

- Our morning bouldering routine with friends, climbing at 7 AM and going to _La Maison_ for pastries
- The amazing Neapolitan pizza restaurants
- Getting our weekly groceries from _Herbie Unverpackt_ and chatting with Carmela
- The extensive and delicious Turkish food offer in Neukölln
- The Middle Eastern breakfasts on Sonnenallee
- Being welcomed regulars at _La Vineria_, our local wine bar
- Cycling everywhere
- Sunny lunches and coffee breaks by the Landwehr canal
- Playing chess or working at _Geschwister Nothaft Café_
- Reliving the Southeast Asian food stall experience at the Thai Park
- Cooling down in lakes in the summer
- Being max. 15 minutes walk from everything we love
- Weekend trips in Poland to eat pierogi
- The strong and friendly bouldering culture
- Beers and picnics at Tempelhofer Feld
- The carefree pace of life
- Playing table tennis in the streets on summer nights
- Always discovering cool new places to eat and drink
- The diverse mix of people playing pétanque in front of _La Maison_
- The super spicy Sichuanese restaurants
- Glühwein at Christmas markets
- And all the precious friends we've made on the way

I have forgotten many things, for certain. But as my friend Max said: <q>I am not crying, you are</q>.

Anyway. {end-key}
