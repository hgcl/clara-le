## Life Peek: Culinary experiments

I love trying out new recipes—especially the ones that are about creating things that you usually buy. This week, I baked some sourdough croissants. For a first time, it wasn't too bad: not airy, but not dense either, a bit too buttery, but so satisfying. Robin and I had some plain croissants for breakfast, but we also tried a grilled cheese version which was deliciously decadent.

Another recipe I tried this week are those <a href="/recipes/vegetarian-polish-cabbage-rolls">vegetarian Polish cabbage rolls</a>. It is not easy finding out winter dishes that are seasonal and that make me excited. These rolls did the job perfectly.

  They also exist in Germany as <em>Kohlrouladen</em>, but I stumbled upon the
  vegetarian Polish version first.

## Read & Watched

### [Crazy Rich Asians (movie, 2018)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Rich_Asians_%28film%29)

A light rom com that gives just what you are expecting from it. It is cheesy, overacted, but very entertaining. (And you just have to love Awkwafina.)

### [Blade Runner (movie, 1982)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner)

I finally watched this classic that wonderfully depicts the year 2019: dark and polluted, people from all nationalities mixing, not one dominant language, strong Japanese video game feel. Human-like and life-like androids are a thing. People still have retro haircuts and clothes—of course. I loved the strong vibrations of the soundtrack. Tonight, we are watching the 2049 edition.

## Discovered

### [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/)

Musixmatch is another one of these tools that have been lying around forever and that I just discovered recently. It connects with your Spotify account and shows you the synced song lyrics. We have already had a few spontaneous karaokes and I love it.

### [Five Books](https://fivebooks.com/)

I discovered Five Books through [Dunlop's interview](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/fuchsia-dunlop-on-chinese-food/) about Chinese food books. The concept is amazing: asking experts to recommend five books in their subject. The result is a curated list of very good books in any fields you can think of.
