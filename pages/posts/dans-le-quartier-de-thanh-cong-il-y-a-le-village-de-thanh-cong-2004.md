_Directed by Vàng Anh Phan Thi_

This short of 33 minutes brought me right back in the streets of Hanoi.

Through her lense, Vàng Anh Phan Thi shows us the reality of living in this small neighborhood. The speakers installation storyline felt almost like a backdrop to the daily lives of Thanh Công inhabitants.

Rating: 4/5 {end-key}
