Now in Berlin for more than two years with my partner [Robin](https://robinmetral.com/).

I am actively working on not being blown away by the wind and rain, and getting used to waking up in the dark. I boulder two or three times a week with friends—usually at 7am before going for pastries together.

I am currently nurturing my very new [digital garden](https://garden.clarale.com/). For once, I am trying to [not over-complicate the process](/posts/gardening/) to make the habit easier to build.

As usual, I am reading sci-fi books. I finally started the [Dune series](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL893415W/Dune/) after watching the recent movie by Villeneuve. _I needed to know what happened next!_

I planted an avocado seed a few months back and finally gave it a name (Sigmund). It is now 55 cm tall and not dying—yet.

Otherwise, I spend most of my free time typing and clicking away on my laptop, working full-time as a visual designer.
