There is a new kid in town and its name is _duotone_.

You've certainly seen that refreshing effect used more than once this past year. The duotone effect consists of combining two contrasting colors in your image — one color for the dark tones and one color for the light tones.

You can easily use this effect to strengthen a brand visual identity based on a few colors and get a vibrant result.

Let's get started! 🚀

## Step 1

Choose a super cool image and open the <code>Layers</code> panel (<code>Window > Layers</code>). Click on the <code>Adjustment Layer</code> icon — the black and white circle thingy — and select <code>Gradient Map…</code>

## Step 2

A gradient preview appears, click on it to open the <code>Gradient Editor</code>. (The default gradient looks okay, but meh, it would just be waaay too easy 😘)

## Step 3

Here comes the fun part. Double-click on the left Color Stop to change its color. Do the same for the right Color Stop.

- By default, the _left Color Stop_ replaces the dark tones of your picture 🕶
- The _right Color Stop_ replaces the light tones ☀

Feel free to move the stops around to control the color distribution 🎨

And here is your duotone image! 🎉

## Step 4 (Optional)

Wanna get a bit crazy and go _triotone_? Add additional Color Stops to your gradient by clicking right underneath it.

In this example, I've added a lighter blue in the middle of my gradient to give more definition to my picture.
