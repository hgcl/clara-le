So yep, I finally got the _disease_. In the last few days of quarantine, I was feeling 100% recovered and had way too much time on my hands. This is what happened.

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; margin: 2rem 0; padding-top: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/695391932?byline=0&portrait=0' frameborder='0' allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

I unexpectedly enjoyed the creative process and even took a few rough notes for the next _\*fingers crossed\*_ project:

- Pay more attention to the little emotional gestures and details. Focus less on going from A to B and more on the little repetitive movements that make the object look alive.
- Be careful about not bumping the camera. Use tripod whenever possible.
- Make sure my body doesn't come in the light way and cause unexpected shadows.
- Think through the logistics for the complex moves first. _E.g. How am I going to make this jar gradually fall? It will avoid extra work remaking scenes._
- Make sure the camera focus is correct to avoid bluriness.
- For one viewpoint, simulate the whole sequence first to make sure the scene layout is right and everything is where it should be.
