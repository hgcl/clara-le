So yep, I finally got the _disease_. In the last few days of quarantine, I was feeling 100% recovered and had way too much time on my hands. This is what happened.

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; margin: 2rem 0; padding-top: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/695391932?byline=0&portrait=0' frameborder='0' allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

I unexpectedly enjoyed the creative process and even [took a few rough notes](/learning#stop-motion-first-steps) for the next _\*fingers crossed\*_ project.
