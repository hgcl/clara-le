I realized that I change my website more often than I go shopping. I can't decide if it's a good or bad thing.

Even if he says otherwise, that's because of [Robin](https://robinmetral.com/). He recently came up with [brut, his own static site generator,](https://brut.pages.dev/) as an answer to existing generators lack of simplicity and stability.

For a noob coder like me, trying to keep up with Next.js constant breaking changes was draining. It made my personal website feel like a chore to maintain.

So as soon as the alpha version of brut was out, I proceeded to remake my entire website based on it. I took this opportunity to simplify the UI and focus on accessibility. For my blog posts, I also moved away from my customized MDX files towards simpler Markdown files. This was to make sure any future transitions I wanted to make[^1] would be as seamless as possible.

Even though, my last website was terribly non-accessible, I did like it. So as a tribute to it, before it forever disappears in the that-was-my-website graveyard of the World Wide Web, I toast to it one last time:

[^1]: As we all know this new website will only last until the next redesign craze comes around.
