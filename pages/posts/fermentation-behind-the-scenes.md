In the last few years, I have superficially dabbled with fermenting my own food, making kimchi, Sauerkraut, kombucha or kefir. I have also learned that so many of the things I drink or eat are in fact fermented—think cheese, wine, beer, yogurt, bread.

Since Wednesday, I have been diving deep into the intricate world of fermentation from a complete other direction. I stepped outside my comfort zone and had a look at this whole fermentation shenanigan from the point of view of biochemistry.

Here are the things I've learned. <span class="subtle">(Disclaimer: I am mostly quoting Wikipedia as that's where my fermentation rabbit hole started. Please get back to me if I wrote anything wrong-I-don't-really-know-what-I'm-talking-about.)</span>

## What is fermentation?

In biochemistry, _fermentation_ is the process where living organisms extract energy from carbohydrates (e.g. starch or sugar) in the absence of oxygen. There are tons of different fermentation processes that can produce a number of things: alcohol (a.k.a. ethanol), acid, carbon dioxide, and others.

For instance, yeasts are used in wine and beer-making to produce alcohol, while bacteria are used for yogurts to produce acid. Sometimes, a mix of both yeasts and bacteria can be used in tandem as well.

Let's have a look at a few types of fermentation used in the food-industry—because who cares about the other types anyway.[^1]

[^1]: Actually, fermentation also occurs in other super interesting cases. For instance, during intense exercise, Mammalian muscles will undergo fermentation and transform some of those stored sugars into energy and lactic acid as a by-product. I now finally understand why my arms hurt after an intense climbing session!

## Lacto fermentation

_Lacto fermentation_, also called _lactic acid fermentation_, is the process where lactic acid bacteria (LAB) convert sugars into energy, with lactic acid (and sometimes other stuff as well) as by-products. This occurs in an anaerobic environment[^2].

Common examples of lacto fermentation are kimchi, Sauerkraut or yogurt. LAB already naturally exists in many vegetables, so you don't need to add external bacteria for the fermentation to occur.

Let's use the [Sauerkraut recipe](/recipes/german-sauerkraut/) as an example. At its simplest, you only need to mix cabbage with water and let it rest at room temperature to kickstart the fermentation process. Notice how the recipe insists on preventing the minced cabbage from coming in contact with the air. The reason is to keep the environment anaerobic, where LAB thrive whereas other \*bad bacteria\* would die. As the fermentation goes, all the glucose present in the cabbage is transformed into lactic acid, making Sauerkraut sour.

[^2]: An anaerobic environment has no oxygen.

## Ethanol fermentation

_Ethanol fermentation_ or _alcoholic fermentation_ is the process where yeasts—a.k.a. mushrooms—convert sugars into energy in an anaerobic environment (same old, same old). However, this time, the by-products are ethanol and carbon dioxide.

In the case of food, ethanol makes things—well—alcoholic, whereas carbon dioxide produces bubbles. In short, this type of fermentation is used for wines, beers, whiskeys, rums and tons of other alcoholic beverages.

In most cases, the brewers will let the carbon dioxide escape during a primary fermentation. When needed, a second fermentation (sometimes with extra yeast) can be done in the final bottle. As the carbon dioxide doesn't have anywhere to go, it is integrated into the liquid as bubbles—yay! Beers and sparkly wines are perfect examples of this second fermentation.

> Fun fact: ethanol fermentation also takes place in some species of fish where it provides energy when oxygen is scarce.

## Carbonic maceration

_Carbonic maceration_ is a fermentation technique usually used for specific types of wines (e.g. Beaujolais). It results in wines with low tannins that should be drunk young.

It actually falls under the ethanol fermentation family. The difference is that instead of crushing the grapes, most of the fruits are kept whole in a sealed container. The fruits at the bottom are crushed­—because of _duh_ gravity—and undergo conventional ethanol fermentation. The carbon dioxide produced saturates the air, creating an anaerobic environment[^3]. The carbon dioxide gas stimulates the fermentation process, which occurs inside of each berry.

Carbonic maceration started as a winemaking technique, but people have started using it during coffee preprocessing. Before the coffee berries are ready to be roasted, they need to first be fermented, so that the fruit pulp can be removed from the seed. The method is similar: keep the berries intact in a closed vessel to undergo a carbonic maceration. In the case of coffee, the vessel is pumped with extra carbon dioxide to begin with. The resulting coffee profiles are often described as more intense.

[^3]: Carbon dioxide is heavier than oxygen. As it saturates the tank, oxygen is pushed out from the tank through a one-way valve.

## Special mention: SCOBY

A SCOBY is a _symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast_. It is a culinary fermentation culture (or starter) where we find both yeasts and bacteria living in harmony—isn't it beautiful?

Common examples of food / drinks made from a SCOBY are kombucha, kefir, sourdough bread, vinegar, soy sauce or sour beers.

A SCOBY is a mix of yeast, LAB, and acetic acid bacteria (AAB).

The SCOBY, when mixed with water and sugar-rich ingredients, undergo multiple types of fermentation and oxidation. To be completely honest, I haven't fully understood what ferments what and when. But all in all, yeasts consume sugars and produce ethanol. The LAB are anaerobic, consume sugars and produce lactic acid. The AAB are aerobic[^4], consume either sugars or ethanol and produce acetic acid.

[^4]: They like oxygen.
