## Life peek: Habit tracking

Instead of proactively working on my new habits this last week, I procrastinated—again—by setting up overkill habit trackers.

I call them overkill because my habit goals are pretty simple:

1. _Easy_: I want to be up by 7am every day.
2. _Medium_: Take at least two 15-minute breaks on work days.
3. _Hard_: Turn off laptop by 7pm every day.

I told you about my [recent obsession](/posts/10-on-obsessions) with building this website. A consequence is that I spend way too much time on my computer. To gather some stats about my screen time, I installed [TimeFibers](https://timefibers.com/) on my laptop and the [StayFree app](https://stayfreeapps.com/) on my phone.[^1]

Every month now, I will try to give a completely transparent habit report to keep me accountable. Most importantly, I will start _actually_ doing some habits this week—pinky swear.

## Antilibrary

### [1984 (graphic novel, 2020)](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL30787528M/1984)

While browsing books on Open Library, I stumbled upon this graphic novel version of <cite>1984</cite> by Fido Nesti. This being a graphic novel, I pre-judge it by its cover and don't think twice before adding it to my antilibrary.

### [The Art of Fermentation (book)](https://www.wildfermentation.com/the-art-of-fermentation/)

In <cite>The Preserve Journal Issue 4</cite>, journalist Kaszmarzyk says{" "}

> I believe everyone goes through the same thing when they receive their first copy of <cite>The Art of Fermentation</cite>: you spend days with it. You bond and form a relationship like no other with it, because it's neither a recipe book nor a nonfiction novel, it is its own special world.

### [Classic Food of China (book)](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/fuchsia-dunlop-on-chinese-food/)

I have been digitally browsing a lot of cookbooks recently. Chinese cooking expert Fuchsia Dunlop warmly recommends <cite>Classic Food of China</cite> by Yan-Kit So. What I like about this book is that it's not only about food as it also gives insights about culture and history.

## Discovered

### [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)

I have just stumbled upon this gem again as I was sorting through my old bookmarks. I immediately added it to my [bookmarks](/bookmarks/). It is not a website, nor a book, but a treasure chest of practical information about typography.

[^1]: A digital solution to a digital problem? Yep, I'm not sure it's a good idea either.
