I am based in Berlin since 3+ years and working as a UX designer.

Outside of work, you'll find me bouldering and sharing morning pastries with friends.

A few side-projects:

- Nurturing my planner shop _[Life Under Control](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LifeUnderControl/)_, aiming for one new listing every month
- Reading <cite>100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People</cite> by Susan M. Weinschenk and updating [my UX learnings notes](/posts/ui-ux-learnings/) accordingly
- Going through a [wine tasting project](https://www.rafaeldelima.com/) with Robin consisting of trying 73 different wines. Current progress: 2/73
- Participating in my first D&D campaign. My character is a dragonborn who is on a personal cooking quest. {end-key}
