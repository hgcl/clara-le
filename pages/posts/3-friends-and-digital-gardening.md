What a week! I feel like so many things happened since last week.

## Heart-to-heart interview

First of all, I finally had my interview with three people from my current company. For the first time in my life, I have answered to these interview questions with 100% honesty. It felt quite liberating to be completely myself and not give half-truths that are more aligned with people expectations.

## An app to feel closer to your friends

Robin introduced our small group of friends to the [Cappuccino App](https://capp.fm/).

How does it work? Every day, you have the possibility to record one _bean_ that will be mixed with the beans from your friends in a podcast-like format — with background music and everything! You can also give prompts or ask questions if you don't like going on about your day.

I love it. This app arrived right on time, as you currently don't have the possibility to meet your friends anymore. I love the fact that there is no possible small talk. No one is in front of you. You get straight to what is important. I feel like I have learned so much about my friends in just a few cappuccini.

It is also true the other way around. I am usually quite reserved, but feel like talking about myself much more within these short 3 minutes.

## Reset of my digital garden

Middle of the week, I did it. I completely resetted my digital garden. I had first started it without much of a system. It rapidly got out of hands and began to feel chaotic and a bit overwhelming — far from the thinking-buddy-second-brain-thingy I had imagined.

I started it again following [The Zettelkasten Method: Examples to help you get started](https://medium.com/@rebeccawilliams9941/the-zettelkasten-method-examples-to-help-you-get-started-8f8a44fa9ae6) by Rebecca Williams to the letter. It felt great to work on a blank slate with a clear system in mind, knowing where I was headed. {end-key}
