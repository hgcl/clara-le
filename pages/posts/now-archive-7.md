I am just starting my [early retirement parenthesis](/posts/29-time-for-a-break/) â€” a.k.a, I am unemployed for the first time in four years. I do have a few productive plans for these next few months, but to be honest, I mostly want to slow down a bit and enjoy life differently.

Currently, I spend most of my days:

- reading sci-fi novels
- tending to the garden
- blogging here and [there](https://eaudepoisson.com/)
- climbing outdoors and at my local gym
- working on a private Pocket alternative with Robin
- exploring new recipes
- doing small creative projects
- learning Typescript
- drinking wine with France
