A non-exhaustive list of things noticed during our 2-week trip in Sicily:

- People saying "bombastic"
- Traffic rules seem to simply be suggestions here
- Savory or sweet, everything is fried
- _Arancina_ or _arancino_, that is the question[^1]
- _Pani câ meusa_ (or spleen sandwich) is surprisingly good
- Breakfast (when there is one) should be sweet
- Bread is yellow, not sure why
- _Cassata_ might be one of the rare "layered cake" I like
- Recycling is going strong
- So many stray cats
- You can make a carb with carb with carb sandwich[^2]
- You don't need Photoshop to get clear turquoise water 
- The landscape looks similar to some parts of the Ardèche region in France (but as a drier version most of the time)

[^1]: There is apparently a strong debate between West (_arancina_ team) and East (_arancino_ team) Sicily on how to call these delicious rice balls.
[^2]: Thinking of the _panelle e crocchè_ sandwich that is made with bread, chickpea fritters and fried potato balls
