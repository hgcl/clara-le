6.20 AM

The last days were spent sorting four years of stuff, painting walls, and deep cleaning our flat. Between chores, we said goodbye to places and friends.

These few morning hours (or minutes) awake will probably be the last we spend in Berlin as residents. So many memories, so many feelings â€” what a grand adventure it was!

Next time I write will be from France. See you there! {end-key}
