This new website layout is quite minimalist and mostly plays on typography styles and hierarchy. I wanted to add some _spice_ to such a simple base â€” so what better way than doing it rainbow-style on hyperlinks?[^1]

The general idea is that my hyperlinks are underlined by default[^2] as they are the same color as the body text. When hovered of focused, they are animated with CSS keyframes that seamlessly transition through a list of colors. To differentiate the `focus` from `hover` state, I removed the underline and added an `outline` around the link instead[^3].

As you noticed, I am not a very talented web dev blogger, so I'll just drop my CSS below.

```
a {
  color: white;
  text-underline-position: under;
}

a:hover {
  animation: color-change 5s infinite;
}

a:focus {
  animation: color-change 5s infinite;
  text-decoration: none;
  outline-offset: 0.1em;
  outline: 0.1em solid;
}

@keyframes color-change {
  5% {
    color: hsl(0, 100%, 30%);
  }
  15% {
    color: hsl(41, 100%, 33%);
  }
  30% {
    color: hsl(140, 100%, 27%);
  }
  50% {
    color: hsl(230, 100%, 50%);
  }
  70% {
    color: hsl(261, 100%, 55%);
  }
  90% {
    color: hsl(320, 100%, 31%);
  }
}
```

{end-key}

[^1]: Please don't answer to that, this is a rhetorical question.
[^2]: Accessibility note: If your links are not underlined, you have to make sure [they contrast enough with your body text](https://webaim.org/resources/linkcontrastchecker/).
[^3]: Just tab through the links to test it out!
