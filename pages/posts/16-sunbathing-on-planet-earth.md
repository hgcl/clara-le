## Life Peek: Sunbathing on planet Earth

Last week, Robin and I were [walking on the frozen canal](/posts/15-walk-on-the-frozen-canal). This weekend, we took off our hats, coats and gloves, had a long walk outside that finished in the best possible way—with a cup of coffee in the sun.

On February 18, 2021, NASA's Perseverance rover landed on Mars. At the exact same time, something else was happening. I was completing the first illustration of my _Tiny Worlds_ project. Have a look at the [final SVG](/playground/tiny-world-1).

## Read & Watched

### [Sourdough (2017)}](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17840828W/Sourdough)

Robin Sloan has a way of mixing genres. <cite>Sourdough</cite> is both very modern and slightly fantastical. Even though, the ending left me a bit _meh_, I still really liked the overall book and plot. This is my favorite book by Robin Sloan so far.

### [Onward (2020)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onward_(film)>)

Many movie gems passed right under our noses in 2020, <cite>Onward</cite> is one of them. It is set in a fantasy world where magic has been forgotten, where unicorns are another kind of rats and elves use electricity.

Due to some circumstances, an unassured young elf goes on an epic treasure hunt with his brother. It is a journey of self discovery, bonding and coming of age.

## T(W)IL

### To make Biang Biang noodles

Biang Biang noodles come from the Shaanxi province in China. They are deliciously chewy and are super simple to make. This weekend, Robin and I followed [this recipe](/recipes/biang-biang-noodles) by _My Name is Andong_. We had a lot of fun making them, and even more eating them.

### To bake some pastéis de nata

After the noodles, we needed a dessert. A friend had recommended [this recipe](/recipes/pasteis-de-nata) to me by _Babish Culinary Universe_. I like how he goes through the extra effort of making the [laminated dough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_dough)—just learned that English word—from scratch.

The result was much better than I had expected. It was maybe slightly too sweet for me (and let's not even talk about how my microwave-oven stops at 230&nbsp;°C only).
