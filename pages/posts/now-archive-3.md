I have now been in Berlin for more than three years—kinda crazy.

My routine mostly consists of bouldering a few times a week, meeting with friends for morning pastries and working as a visual designer.

A few current side-projects:

- Nurturing my planner shop _[Life Under Control](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LifeUnderControl/)_
- Building my website from scratch—yes, _again_—with [brut](https://github.com/robinmetral/brut/)
