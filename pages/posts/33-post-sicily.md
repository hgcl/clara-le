Our first trip to Sicily came to an end yesterday, as we took a 13-hour ferry from Palermo (Sicily) to Cagliari (Sardinia). These two last weeks in Sicily were full of discoveries. We are bringing back home some new recipes—_caponata, pasta alla Trapanese, panelle,pistacchio pesto_, and also many bottles of local specialties[^1].

Even though we will only be home in a few days[^2], it already feels like the end of a vacation. I am both anxious and excited to be back in our little Ardèche corner. I am looking forward to seeing friends, climbing, cooking, and gardening again. I am however a bit anxious about being jobless _for real_ and having days full of _nothing planned_ for the first time in years. In the end, it all comes down to taking responsibility for how you choose to spend your days and how you live your life.[^3]

Another thing I am bringing back home is inspiration from people I've met and things I've seen on the way:
- Isabel and Baptiste, singing and shoulder-dancing their hearts during our roadtrip
- Outstanding sea flora and fauna that can be observed with simple snorkeling masks
- Davide and his wife starting to make their own wine, honey and olive oil
- Those winemakers offering us a bottle of wine 
- Georgia and Davide moving to the heart of Sicily to open their B&B for climbers
- Old ladies feeding stray cats
- Alice, traveling alone through Italy with only a backpack and camping gears

[^1]: alcoholic ones
[^2]: We are crossing Sardinia to get a ferry to France in three days.
[^3]: Ugh, I definitely need to learn to take the pressure off.
