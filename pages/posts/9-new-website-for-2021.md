## Life peek: New website for 2021

I had an incredibly productive last week of the year, as I threw together my new website from scratch[^1]. Having a clear and attainable goal really helped me speed learn through the basics of React. I realized that I actually do learn best by _doing_.

With Robin, we spent New Year's eve doing a number of adult things:

1. having a fancy meal (homemade tagliatelle topped with [this grated cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belper_Knolle))
2. with wine (brought back from our cycling trip to the Chianti region)
3. discussing our Year in Review (based on [Schalfman's template](https://annualreview.life/))
4. going to bed at 11.15pm

## Read & Watched

### [Soul (movie, 2020)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(2020_film)>)

We all agree that 2020 was pretty sad in terms of movie releases. Well, Pixar just saved the year by releasing <cite>Soul</cite>, an animated movie about passion, jazz, purpose and what it means to be alive. I just added it to my list of favorite Pixar movies of all time—just next to [_Coco_ (2017)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_(2017_film)>).[^2]

## Antilibrary

Everything is closed in Berlin at the moment, except for restaurant takeouts, grocery stores and... bookstores. We decided to cycle to Dussman, a giant bookstore with an amazing English section. It couldn't be avoided, my [antilibrary](/antilibrary/) got quite a few additions.

### [Piranesi (2020)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piranesi_(novel)>)

As usual, I spent way too much time in the fantasy / sci-fi section. With its mythological, dreamy setup, <cite>Piranesi</cite> really reminded me of _[Circe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeline_Miller#Circe)_ by Madeline Miller—which I loved. This novel by Susanna Clarke will probably
not be in the antilibrary very long as I intend to read it _very_ soon.

### [Children of Time (2015)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Time_(novel)>)

I know nothing about the author—Adrian Tchaikovsky, but I know I love smart sci-fi and space odysseys that dive into civilization building. I am adding it here for next time I will be in this kind of mood.

## Discovered

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Okay, this tool is definitely not new on the market. But as I only knew HTML and CSS so far, Tailwind CSS was a little revolution. It made the whole website building process a lot easier and beginner-friendly for me.

[^1]: Or practically in my map of the world, as I used this [Next.js starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter).
[^2]: I also watched the new DC release: <cite>WW84</cite>, but needed to close my eyes at times because it was just too cheesy to witness.
