It is. When designing for print, you are bound to make mistakes as a beginner. There are just  too many  things to think about. But don't fret. The world of print design is also fascinating and deeply satisfying‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust imagine holding your freshly printed [insert your project name] üòç Get started, experiment, and welcome to the world of print design! (But try to avoid these mistakes if you can‚Ä¶ ü§û) 1. Don't use RGB colors, design in¬†CMYK.    The RGB colors you've been using (almost) all your life on screen are based on light. Red, Green and Blue lights are added together to reproduce other colors. However, your printer is much more limited and won't be able to reproduce all the colors you see on screen. It's because it has to mix the four CMYK inks (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key) to obtain a new color. So what?  Make sure to select the CMYK color mode, when creating your artwork. And if possible, always base your color decisions on a physical CMYK or Pantone color chart. 2. Your images resolution is too¬†low.    Simply inserting this super cool image you found on the web into your print design can often lead to disaster. If you don't want to get a very pixelated result, your image resolution should always be between 300 ppi (pixels per inch) and 400 ppi. So what?  Even if the image quality seems to look good on screen, it might not be the case in print. Always check that your artwork resolution is above the 300 ppi threshold. 3. You haven't thought about the bleed and quiet¬†borders.    Need to print to the border very edge? Set up a  bleed  before creating your design. The bleed is an outer-margin that you set around your document borders. All the graphics that touch the borders will be slightly extended to the bleed limit, before being trimmed to the sheet size after print. Thanks to the bleed, you won't have any unwanted white border appearing along the edges of the artwork. The  quiet border  is a safety margin inside your document, where no essential elements‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsuch as text or logo‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshould be placed. This border is necessary as the trimming process is not always precise and can cut off important information. So what?  Set up a bleed of 3‚Äì5 mm and a quiet border of 10‚Äì15 mm for a regular A4 paper. These limits should be adjusted to your printer and paper size. As a rule of thumb, the bigger the sheet, the wider the bleed / quiet border. 4. You don't really know how to use¬†black.    You are writing down your copy, selecting black ‚¨õ as a text fill color and are ready to print! Well,  maybe not . Double-click on the black fill you used and check the CMYK code. It might be something like C75-M68-Y67-K90. Using all four inks to write in black can result in blurry text‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand that's bad. What you really need is to use the following code: C0-M0-Y0-K100. However, when applied on a larger area that black tone will look almost grey. For best results, switch to a  rich black  by mixing several ink colors to get a darker tone. There is not one recipe, but try to use the C40-M30-Y30-K100 CMYK code for those large areas. So what?  Use a crisp black C0-M0-Y0-K100 for small text, and a rich black for large black areas C40-M30-Y30-K100. If possible, directly check with your printer what their specifications for rich black are. 5. Your characters are too¬†thin.    Depending on your printer capacities, your very small and thin characters might not be printed at all. So be careful with fine hairlines and tiny text! Another common mistake is to use small text on a rich black background. The slight misalignment of printing plates might make your characters illegible. When you have white text over black, use a C0-M0-Y0-K100 simple black to avoid this possible blur üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So what?  Don't use tiny text in your artwork. 6pt character size is a good rule of thumb‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven though it all depends on your typeface style! When using small white text over black, choose a C0-M0-Y0-K100 simple black. 6. Haven't proofread your¬†file?    Yes, proofreading is boring. It is so easy to publish a blog post, notice a typo, and correct it afterwards. However, spelling mistakes are the worst in print design. When printing hundreds of posters, that small typo reproduced over and over again might not seem so trivial anymore üò® So what?  Always and systematically proofread and review your artwork before sending it to the printer. As a designer, also check for spelling mistakes and typos even if you haven‚Äôt written the original copy. 7. You haven‚Äôt embedded your graphics and text.    Your artwork is looking good and ready for print. You are especially happy about this super fancy font that you‚Äôve found on Creative Market! üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Just sending your design for print (even in PDF format) is not always a good idea. In all probability, the printers you are working with won‚Äôt have that fancy font and some problems might occur ‚Äî some characters might be replaced, or disappear altogether. Make sure to embed all fonts in your artwork, before sending it to your printer. Outlining any stroke in your artwork to convert them into shapes and flattening all your work layers are also good practices. So what?  Don‚Äôt forget to embed your fonts, outline your artwork strokes and flatten your layers. 8. You forgot about ink coverage.    To print an artwork using CMYK colors, your printer will use four plates of inks that combined together in dot patterns will make up an image. Your printer and paper will often have an ink coverage limit. For example, let‚Äôs say you apply a rich black C70-M70-Y70-K100 on a large area. That area ink coverage would amount to 70+70+70+100=310%. Most standard printers can handle an ink coverage of 260%. Going over this limit can result in quality problems and warped paper. So what?  Check with your printer what their ink coverage is, and make sure that the colors you use fit this limit. 9. You‚Äôve been using the wrong format.    Are you about to export your artwork into PNG or GIF files for print? üò± These formats were developed for screen only. They have a resolution that is too low for print, as well as a reduced color capacity. So what?  For best results, export your file into a PDF format before sending it to your printer. 10. You thought a hard-copy proof wasn‚Äôt necessary.    Getting a hard-copy proof from your printer is not always necessary. But the bigger your project is, the more critical it becomes to see a physical example of your work before printing 10,000 other copies. Also make sure to use your printer color chart if they have one! So what?  Get a hard-copy proof of your work and check with your client that everything is perfect before scaling up.  Alright, you now know the basics and are ready to go ‚Äî all by yourself ü§ß Do your best {end-key}"},{ id: 2, directory: "Musings", title: "#10 On obsessions", subtitle: "Update #10", slug: "/posts/10-on-obsessions", dateCreated: "2021-01-10",  content: "    Meh print  by Ryan Putnam   Life peek: On obsessions  Since the last week of December, I have been  obsessively  working on my website. Being pretty new to coding, I am always discovering exciting things to try out in this new playground. The downside is when the obsession gets out of control. It is not uncommon that I stay up until late in the evening building a non-essential feature. Feeling excited to work on my website is good. The problem is that it replaces other things that I deem important: thinking, reading, cooking, writing, AFK time. In the coming week, I will set up a few healthy habit trackers.

I call them overkill because my habit goals are pretty simple:   Easy : I want to be up by 7am every day.  Medium : Take at least two 15-minute breaks on work days.  Hard : Turn off laptop by 7pm every day.  I told you about my  recent obsession  with building this website. A consequence is that I spend way too much time on my computer.

Antilibrary   1984 (graphic novel, 2020)   While browsing books on Open Library, I stumbled upon this graphic novel version of  1984  by Fido Nesti. This being a graphic novel, I pre-judge it by its cover and don't think twice before adding it to my antilibrary.  The Art of Fermentation (book)   In  The Preserve Journal Issue 4 , journalist Kaszmarzyk says  I believe everyone goes through the same thing when they receive their first copy of  The Art of Fermentation : you spend days with it. You bond and form a relationship like no other with it, because it's neither a recipe book nor a nonfiction novel, it is its own special world.   Classic Food of China (book)   I have been digitally browsing a lot of cookbooks recently. Chinese cooking expert Fuchsia Dunlop warmly recommends  Classic Food of China  by Yan-Kit So. What I like about this book is that it's not only about food as it also gives insights about culture and history. Discovered   Practical Typography   I have just stumbled upon this gem again as I was sorting through my old bookmarks. I immediately added it to my  bookmarks . It is not a website, nor a book, but a treasure chest of practical information about typography. {end-key}  Footnotes    A digital solution to a digital problem?

This week, I baked some sourdough croissants. For a first time, it wasn't too bad: not airy, but not dense either, a bit too buttery, but so satisfying. Robin and I had some plain croissants for breakfast, but we also tried a grilled cheese version which was deliciously decadent. Another recipe I tried this week are those  vegetarian Polish cabbage rolls . It is not easy finding out winter dishes that are seasonal and that make me excited. These rolls did the job perfectly.   They also exist in Germany as  Kohlrouladen , but I stumbled upon the vegetarian Polish version first.  Read &#x26; Watched   Crazy Rich Asians (movie, 2018)   A light rom com that gives just what you are expecting from it. It is cheesy, overacted, but very entertaining. (And you just have to love Awkwafina.)  Blade Runner (movie, 1982)   I finally watched this classic that wonderfully depicts the year 2019: dark and polluted, people from all nationalities mixing, not one dominant language, strong Japanese video game feel. Human-like and life-like androids are a thing. People still have retro haircuts and clothes ‚Äî of course. I loved the strong vibrations of the soundtrack. Tonight, we are watching the 2049 edition. Discovered   Musixmatch   Musixmatch is another one of these tools that have been lying around forever and that I just discovered recently. It connects with your Spotify account and shows you the synced song lyrics. We have already had a few spontaneous karaokes and I love it.  Five Books   I discovered Five Books through  Dunlop's interview  about Chinese food books. The concept is amazing: asking experts to recommend five books in their subject.

I feel like so many things happened since last week. Life peek: Holiday at home  This week was a bit special as both Robin and I took time off work without any holiday plans. We spent most of it having outdoor walks, doing pizza-related activities and working on our personal projects.  Yes , I did spend a disproportionate amount of time working on my website.  1   I love adding new features to my website and learning to code. The problem is that this website should be a  side -side-project at best. The reality is that it takes time away from things I would like to focus on. Something I stopped doing is my routine of reading essays / working on my digital garden. Lately, I am learning a lot coding-wise but not much outside of that. In that direction,  The Knitting Club  that Mirha Masala launched with two of her friends inspired me a lot. Every three weeks, they choose a topic, a skill or an activity. The three friends then share their experiences and discuss their learnings. I love this idea of having a  learning club  where you grow together and keep each other accountable. Read &#x26; Watched   Kubo and the two strings (2016)   Beautifully crafted stop-motion by the Laika studio, combining traditional stop-motion techniques with CGI. It is funny and poetic with just the right amount of darkness.  Kubo and the two strings  is everything but just a kid movie. Antilibrary   Defining Decade (2013)   The complete title is the very concise  Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter And How To Make The Most Of Them Now  (by Meg Jay). Mirha Masala recommends it as the one book that marked 2020 for her.  We think that by avoiding decisions now, we keep all of our options open for later ‚Äî but not making choices is a choice all the same.  T(W)IL  This week I learned a few new things: To use an API  The Movies page looks pretty much like the existing Books page. The difference? I coded it all by myself and had to learn to use the TMDb API on the way there. I had been trying to do it for weeks, so I am quite happy to have finally managed it! To make a sourdough pizza  Robin and I decided that this past week was going to be  Pizza Week . We tried lots of good pizzas, made some pizza-related powerpoints and also learned to make our own with Andrew Janjigian's  sourdough recipe   2  . The result was delicious but it could definitely be improved ‚Äî even with our tiny microwave oven. {end-key}  Footnotes    Like that night I couldn't sleep and coded until 1am.  ‚Ü©   Janjigian is one of these ‚Äúcooking creators‚Äù who don't just give you a flat recipe ‚Äî but also the story or science behind it.

I guess I just couldn't find a book that really hooked me ‚Äî a book that I was looking forward to going back to. I finally found it this last week. It is called  Girl, Woman, Other  by Bernadine Evaristo. I had never heard of it before, never read anything about it, and simply began reading it with my company book club. I was sucked in and finished it in a few days time.  1   Another book that marked this week is  The Witches  by Roald Dahl. In the evening, I put on some background music, turn on some warm lights and Robin and I take turns, reading the book aloud to each other. We used to do the same with  Le Petit Nicholas  by Jean-Jacques Semp√©, a series of French children's books ‚Äî that are also great for adults. One last book-related update: I have finally imported all my books from Goodreads to my own personal bookshelves. It feels liberating to completely own my book data for the first time in a while! Read & Watched   Girl, Woman, Other (2019)   Beautifully written in a stream of consciousness style. We jump into the lives of 12 girls, women ‚Äî others ‚Äî in England. From one mind to the next, we get to know and understand them through each other's perceptions, discovering how it is never as simple as it seems. Strong recurring themes are feminism, politics, sexuality and otherness. The characters are ‚Äúothered‚Äù by society for their skin color, sexuality, gender ‚Äî sometimes even othering one another.  Do the right thing (1989)   I am almost ashamed to say that we chose to watch this movie because it had a pizza theme. Our  Pizza Week  brought us many joys, and  Do the right thing  was definitely a surprise hightlight. Spike Lee directed it in the 80s, but its topics are still ‚Äî sadly ‚Äî very relevant today. For me, this movie was  fluid . Everything glides and moves, up, up, keeping you in your seat until the end. One recommendation: choose your movies based on what you eat. Food for Thought   Environmental Impacts of Food (2020)   This might be the most thought-provoking article I have read in the past few months.  Environmental Impacts of Food  was written based on the largest meta-analysis on global food systems to date ‚Äî with data from 38,000 farms and 119 countries. From the analysis, it is pretty clear that what you eat is much more important than how local the produce is. Transportation and packaging account for a very small percentage of the food emissions. What surprised me most is that this is also the case for low-impact meat producers. As a rule of thumb, it is usually better to buy vegetables from across the globe, rather than meat and dairy produces from your local farm. T(W)IL  To bake an amazing banana bread  Robin lived in London for one year and introduced me to this amazing tea-time snack: banana bread. It is warm, slightly toasted, topped with a slice of melted butter. This weekend, I tried baking some banana bread, following  the recipe  a friend from work shared with me. We don't have baking powder at home and made a sourdough version instead. Conclusion: 5 stars of deliciousness that will certainly become a kitchen-regular. My first steps with D3.js  November last year, I gave into the Cyber Week craze and got a discounted version of the  D3.js &#x26; Firebase  MOOC. For context, I knew almost nothing about JavaScript at that time and realized that the course was way above my level. I started the course this last week and now understand all of it without much difficulty. It is incredible to see how far I've come since the end of 2020.

I watched it as some Brazilian friends recommended it to me, without knowing anything about its plot. It starts a few years from now in a tiny isolated village in rural Brazil. It is a direct reference to  quilombos  ‚Äî historical places of resistance where slaves ran away from their masters during Portuguese colonial times. Midway through the movie, we suddenly realize we are in a dystopian future, mixing genres from action to sci-fi. Very original, slow and tense, a critic of its times. Food for thought   The Great Unbundling (2020)   In this interview of Casper ter Kuile, they talk about the unbundling process ‚Äî or how spirituality, community and rituals that were once part of religious institutions, are taking on new contemporary forms. People now find community in their fitness communities, justice groups or workplace. Young people are less and less religious, but still yearn for spirituality ‚Äî moments infused with meaning and intention. I have just started his book  The Power of Ritual . In it, Casper explains how you can bring back meaning to things you do everyday‚Äîit might be your brewing coffee routine, meditation or journalling practice. This idea of making things meaningful and intentional really speaks to me and I am looking forward to going back to the book ‚Äî which doesn't happen often with nonfiction.

It was half fascinating, half disturbing. In the end, I wouldn't even particularly recommend it (the disturbing parts were too much for me). However, once you are caught up in the story, you cannot really stop as you  need  to know what happens next.

During the first lockdown, Robin and I proceeded to watch all the MCU movies in an order that made sense plot-wise. Now that we are up to speed, we just  cannot  miss a new Marvel movie anymore. More often than not, those movies will be bad  *cough* Black Widow *cough* . But even the bad ones add a new puzzle piece to the entire MCU universe.  Werewolf by night  is a short-ish movie (53 minutes) that came out this year. I found the plot quite straightforward, but I did love the black and white, very Hitchcock-like rendition. If you want to have a short but entertaining evening, I can only recommend it! T(W)IL  To make a green bean casserole  For my friend's Thanksgiving dinner, I prepared a green bean casserole ‚Äî even though I had never tried one and didn't know what it was supposed to taste like. Reading through  the recipe , it looked simple enough and surprisingly close to... a green bean gr√¢tin? I guess that might just be my French upbringing lense distortion, but the recipe felt a lot more approachable once I made this connection in my mind. I would definitely try to make more of these veggie-heavy casseroles / gr√¢tins in the future! {end-key}  Footnotes    I also, just discovered that  Friendsgiving  is apparently a word.  ‚Ü©   Trying to intimidate a baddie with advantage by using my loud voice boomed up 3 times ‚Äî done.  ‚Ü©   "},{ id: 11, directory: "Musings", title: "#19 Sprained ankle and interactive fiction", subtitle: "Update #19", slug: "/posts/19-sprained-ankle-and-interactive-fiction", dateCreated: "2022-12-05",  content: "    Arcade Astronaut by Jordan Jenkins    Life peek  So, my life just took an unexpected turn on Friday morning. As usual, I started the day bouldering with friends. As I was doing a very non-dangerous move  1  , I slipped and fell on the side of my ankle with a lot of speed and strength. It hurt  a lot . Of course, we still had to follow up with our normal routine of getting breakfast first at a local caf√© ‚Äî because  priorities  ‚Äî before taking any drastic decisions, like going to the doctor. Stuffed with pastries and coffee, Robin finally took me on a piggyback ride to the closest doctor. Diagnostic: a very badly sprained ankle and 4‚Äì6 weeks without sport. And that'd only be if the ankle was  not  fractured. Which luckily it was not.  2   Needless to say, a lot of my plans for this month have been reviewed after the  catastrophe . Fortunately, I have a local wine bar five minutes from home where we are welcomed like friends. It is nice to build these local connections in the place you live in, from the coffee shop waiter to the grocery lady. It makes me a bit sad to leave them behind once we'll move away from Berlin. Discovered  An immobilised kind of lifestyle calls for more quiet activities. Fortunately, the list of winners for this year  Interactive Fiction Competition  is out! I proceeded to play three games, which totaled to about 5‚Äì6 hours. The Absence of Miriam Lane   Sometimes people give pieces of themselves away. Sometimes they give too much and who they are wears thin. They become an absence. A hole in the world. And a terrible Light shines through.    The Absence of Miriam Lane   is a choice-based game  3  . The way it was implemented on its plaform is amazing. The black and white imagery, the soundtrack create a very atmospheric environment, in which you are enclosed until the end of the story  4  . A Long Way to the Nearest Star   A thief on the run from the galactic police finds refuge on an abandoned spaceship. A lonely ship AI finds unexpected company.  Similarly,   A Long Way to the Nearest Star   is a choice-based game. The use of the platform is not as creative, but definitely helps with the setting. The difference between your thoughts and the things you read on digital devices (usually the AI talking to you) are stylized perfectly. The game is also quite lengthy ‚Äî if you are a slow player like me ‚Äî and left me with this wonderful feeling of coming out of a very good and absorbing story. And Then You Come to a House Not Unlike the Previous One   Wander through an apparently infinite number of spooky mansions, solving a basic puzzle in each one.  Finally,   And Then You Come to a House Not Unlike the Previous One   is a parser-based game  5  . The official synopsis doesn't tell you much and actually hides the fact that the adventure actually  has a meaning . Starting this game, I was more or less ready to solve a hundred problems, one after the other. However you quickly realize that the story is more complex than that... T(W)IL  To make Kn√∂del  One of the things that inspire me to cook at home is going to the restaurant, eating something delicious and being like: I want to know how to make this. Well, that happened just last week with  Kn√∂del . A few days later, I had made a fresh batch of my own that was not bad at all. Basically, they felt like big gnocchi where you simply swap the potatoes for bread instead.  6   To make lasagna  Yay, lasagna! How come I had never tried before? Not sure, but I will definitely have another go at it very soon. It was much easier than I expected it to be, and the result is just so good! {end-key}  Footnotes    For those interested in the technicalities, it was one of those run along the wall on a long volume move.

Yesterday was a long train day. We left our Berlin home at 7am in the morning and arrived at Robin's parents' place 12 hours later. Thankfully, German trains are equipped with wifi, so we have plenty of things to do during the ride  2  . The last week has felt intense. We had a bunch of stuff to prep and do before leaving Berlin, and I was pretty busy with work as well ‚Äî in a good way. All that rush culminated to a wonderful note on Wednesday evening. My good friend Valentina prepared for us the most delicious bolognese ever. The strict recipe comes straight from her Italian grandmother ‚Äî so we cannot get much more authentic than that. Read &#x26; Watched  Pinocchio (2022)  Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is one of the best animated movies I have watched recently. The stop-motion work is super lively, beautifully made, and close to perfection  3  . The storyline is also much darker than the Disney version, which gives it more depth overall. The Queen's Gambit (2020)  Yes, I'm two years late to the party. Robin watched this miniseries when it came out during the first COVID-19 lockdown. I only found time recently to start  The Queen's Gambit  on my own, and was able to finish it in the 12-hour train ride. And what a ride! I am not sure if it deserves the level of hype it got, but the series definitely gripped me. T(W)IL  To bake a tarte tatin  I tried to bake my first apple tarte tatin this week. We had a bunch of apples and butter we had to finish before they went bad, so it felt like the most fitting recipe. There were a few challenges on the way. First, the puff pastry. I followed  this recipe , and I have to say that it worked quite well! The result didn't have as many layers as a store-bought dough, but it definitely did the job! Second, the caramelized apples. I struggled to make a caramel base that would not burn, but would still hold together when poaching the apples in it. Mine became too liquid, and I removed some of it before baking the pie. My concern was that it would be completely liquid when flipping the pie at the end of the process. The final tarte tatin was still delicious, but the apples were not as beautifully caramelized as I would have wanted them to be. For the next try, I will try to use apples that have less water content  4  , as well as make a dry caramel first before adding the melted butter. {end-key}  Footnotes    We are at a bouldering gym with friends, but I am forced to stay on the bench as I sprained my ankle two weeks ago.  ‚Ü©   All in all, I wrote a new post, added a recipe to my website and watched four episodes of  The Queen's Gambit .  ‚Ü©   Del Toro apparently asked his animators to keep the mistakes in the final rendition to make it look more like stop-motion!  ‚Ü©   I might actually even let them dry for a night after cutting them.  ‚Ü©   "},{ id: 13, directory: "Musings", title: "2022 doodling", subtitle: "Playing around with my graphics tablet", slug: "/posts/2022-doodling", dateCreated: "2022-12-29",  content: " In October, I got a super cool graphics tablet.

On the ride back, I continued restructuring the way  my recipes  are coded  1  , as well as watched two heist movies with Robin. I don't visit people I love in Switzerland as often as I would like to. Days always feel full and intense, as visits and appointments are scheduled one day after another. Yet, I don't miss Lausanne or Geneva. When not meeting with friends or family, I usually get bored in these cities I used to live in. Anyway, we are having one more laid back Christmas party today with close friends from Germany, the US and Brazil. Let's see how this international party deals with the traditional Swiss cheese fondue! I'll personally allow for non-traditional toppings, spices and sides, but let's see what Robin's views are on such blasphemy. At least, it'll be fun to watch. Read &#x26; Watched  Army of Thieves (2021)  Matthias Schweigh√∂fer directed, produced and had the leading role in  Army of Thieves . We watched it on our 12-hour ride back from Switzerland. The plot was unoriginal, but entertaining nonetheless. Schweigh√∂fer's character and performance is pretty amazing, he made us laugh and cry. From my perspective, the movie also gets bonus points for showing locations in Berlin and other parts of Germany. I felt right at home! Army of the Dead (2021)  After watching  Army of Thieves , we discovered that it actually had a sequel that came out the same year! We still had 3 hours left before arriving in Berlin‚Ä¶ so we continued our streak and watched  Army of the Dead  as well. The prequel was more focused on the heist and comedy part of the show, whereas the sequel was much more zombie-action-packed, as well as serious overall. Discovered   Back to the Future   Irina Werning, based in Argentina, looks at people old photographs and helps them reenact these past scenes. In her own words:  I love old photos. I admit being a nosey photographer. As soon as I step into someone else‚Äôs house, I start sniffing for them. Most of us are fascinated by their retro look but to me, it's imagining how people would feel and look like if they were to reenact them today‚Ä¶ In 2011, I decided to actually do this. So, with my camera, I started inviting people to go back to their future.  Robin and I stumbled upon the book documenting this project in a coffee shop  2  . The before / after pictures are funny, shocking and endearing. We will definitely try to do the same with some pictures of our own! T(W)IL  To play chess again  Yesterday, we went to one of our favorite coffee shops in Berlin. We usually go there to work as they have a very tolerant laptop policy. They also have a massive wooden chessboard. Even though Robin is a big chess fan, I am quite reluctant to play with him. On one hand because I don't like to lose  3  , and on the other hand because I just feel lost most of the time. For once, I agreed to play a game with him (and did feel a bit crappy losing badly at the end). However, as we went back home and played some more on  lichess.org , I started to enjoy the puzzles, post-game analysis and trainings available on the platform. Losing hard still leave me quite sore. But seeing it more like a competition with my own abilities (a.k.a. my chess rating), rather than a competitive game against another player, makes me feel much better and excited about the whole thing. {end-key}  Footnotes    I used to directly code the HTML of each recipe. This worked quite well when my recipe layouts were more straightforward. The HTML template I am using is becoming more complex, as it includes  microformats  and needs more styling.

Or have a good slide into the new year, as Germans say. I am back to work after one week of relaxed vacation in Berlin. It feels like much longer though, as we had been to in Switzerland the two previous weeks as well. Nothing much happened since my  last weeknote . Robin and I met with friends for some holiday dinners, we started playing chess, we did our Year in Review  1  , we caught up with our current D&#x26;D campaign, we created a photo album for 2022, and I started to do some rehabilitation exercises for my sprained ankle. Writing this last paragraph, I realize that nothing much was actually a lot. It just felt very laid-back and nice. The perfect vibe for the end of year. People around me are talking a lot about New Year's resolutions. For once, I am looking at the coming year with a very open mind. My main goal is to get acclimated with our new life in the French countryside. Of course, I have a  ton of things I'd love to do there . But I see these more like wishes and ideas than resolutions.  27 days left before the move  Read &#x26; Watched  On body and soul (2017)   On body and soul  is the Hungarian movie that won the Golden Bear at Berlin International Film Festival in 2017. It is just the right amount of weird / sad / heartwarming that keeps you watching. Glass onion (2022)  We had a cozy New Year's Eve with friends, eating ravioli and watching  Glass Onion  on Netflix. The movie is longer than what we expected (2h20), and we finished it only 10 minutes before the midnight deadline. I don't think it will live on as the first movie  Knives Out  might. I still laughed and enjoyed it a lot, watching it only two days ago. However, I will probably not recommend it in one year anymore as it already feels slightly aged. Bad times at the El Royale (2018)  After watching  Glass Onion , we were still in the mood for a murder mystery. We decided to give a chance to  Bad times at the El Royale  that came out a few years back. To be honest, it surprised me in the best way possible. I found the plot enticing, the characters interesting and rather well explored. As far as murder mysteries go, I would definitely recommend this movie for an entertaining night! Discovered  Jessamy Hawke  You can see one of Jessamy Hawke's artwork at the start of this post. She is a UK-based illustrator who mainly works with watercolor and gouache. She is also super active  on Instagram  where I first discovered her. She has a way of illustrating landscapes and scenes, using simple shapes and lines with a lot of different textures.

The lost city  was all of that, plus extra dumb as well. It was perfect. It stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum in a romantic comedy-adventure. The movie doesn't take itself seriously and is just what you need after a long day of work. Also, did you know that there are three series and three other movies called exactly  The lost city  as well?  1   Aftersun (2022)  By Charlotte Wells On the other extreme of the spectrum, there is  Aftersun . What a wonderful debut by director Charlotte Wells! There is so much to love in this movie. To begin with, the cast is incredible. The father-daughter relationship is beautifully depicted, the emotions are hinted at, without being shoved at you. The use of vintage camera imagery is brilliant. This is a movie you might want to rewatch to uncover all the details Wells left there for us. Discovered  I am not a hundred-pinned-tabs kind of person.

However, I wasn't expecting it to also feel touching and wholesome. It made me feel a lot and I would definitely recommend it! John Wick (2014)  By Chad Stahelski Aaah, the John Wick franchise! I am not sure how I managed to never watch such a big blockbuster. I was in need of some light entertainment. So, Robin and I watched the first three movies last week. It was everything I thought it would be. Action-packed, not very smart, very entertaining. Plus, it stars some puppies and a network of assassins who all know each other's on a first name basis. Discovered   Return to Monkey Island   A point-and-click adventure game Most of the things I discover or get into are usually introduced to me by Robin. This game is no exception to this rule. He played the first two pixelated games that came out in 1990 and 1991. More than thirty years later, the original creator, Ron Gilbert is teaming up with designers to create a gorgeous new addition to the  Monkey Island series . This point-and-click adventure is full of quirky dialogues and fun puzzles to solve. It had been a while I hadn't enjoyed a game that much!  Keep talking and nobody explodes   A party game Yesterday, we met with some friends for dinner (pizza) and fun activities. We discovered  Keep talking and nobody explodes . In this collaborative party game, you need to solve puzzles to deactivate a bomb. The only problem is that you control the bomb, your friends have the instructions to defuse it, and you cannot see each other's parts of the game. In short, they'll have to talk you through the instructions fast if you don't want the bomb to explode! It is a super fun game, but very intense and stress-inducing as well. I don't think I could play it for too long or with too many people at once.  Chris Burnell's styleguide   A personal website styleguide I stumbled on Chris Burnell's website while browsing the IndieWeb ring (once again).

After watching a movie, I usually enjoy reading articles or watching videos analyzing it. In one of these explanation videos, I discovered that Benoit Blanc's introduction scene (in the bathroom) shows that he owns  Cain's Jawbone . It is an infamous murder mystery puzzle printed as a book, first published in 1930. Wikipedia will explain the concept better than I could:  The puzzle consists of a 100-page prose narrative with its pages arranged in the wrong order. [...] To solve the puzzle, the reader must determine the correct order of the pages and also the names of the murderers and victims within the story. The story's text includes a large number of quotations, references, puns, Spoonerisms and other word games. The pages can be arranged in 9.33√ó10157 (factorial of 100) possible combinations, but there is only one correct order. The solution to the puzzle has never been made public.

Everything takes more time, which makes me much more intentional about the things I choose to do. Waking up in the morning, I first need to start the wood stove fire. If I'm lucky, it only takes 5 minutes. However, the fire sometimes needs more baby-sitting before properly burning. The weekly market closest to our place is a 15-min drive away. As it is close to other stores, we usually plan in advance if we need something else and get it all at once. Meeting new people is different as well. Everyone is very welcoming and makes me feel like I belong very quickly. It will however probably take time for us to build meaningful relationships.

I am also climbing a lot less efficiently as I spend precious minutes trying out tons of different holds before settling on one. On the opposite side, it is really liberating to be able to reach for any hold you want and decide to use it. The weather was also perfect. We arrived around 1PM and immediately removed jackets and sweaters. It was so sunny that it felt like the start of summer. I also had my first car driving experience. I never learned to drive, but the region really demands it. So far, I just learned to start the car, and I finally realize how much coordination it requires! I'll try to get through my car driving lessons as fast as possible ‚Äî let's see if I can manage to drive a car by the end of the year. Read &#x26; Watched  The second week after our arrival in France, we subscribed to the big library in Aubenas. I love French-speaking libraries, as Belgium and France have a strong comics / graphic novels culture. We used to live next to a library, where we would go every two days to refresh our graphic novel storage. Our current library being 30 minutes from home, we now go every two weeks only. Nevertheless, I am happy to come back to this forgotten routine.  La maison de la plage (2019)   By S√©verine Vidal and Victor L. Pinel  La maison de la plage  ‚Äî  The house on the beach  ‚Äî is a beautiful graphic novel by S√©verine Vidal (scenario) and Victor L. Pinel (drawings). It is really well structured and made me travel through time, with an old family house at its center. Pinel masterly uses lighting and colors in his drawings to create distinct atmospheres and give us a sense of time. At the end of the day, this graphic novel made me feel a lot of different emotions and I would highly recommend it.  Natsuko no Sake (1988)   By Akira Oze  Natsuko no Sake  is my first manga in a while! It is a real love letter to the Japanese tradition of brewing sake. So far, I am only two volumes in ‚Äî there are six volumes in total. I quite like it, but do feel like some of the content has aged a bit ‚Äî nice characters being very sexist, saying inapproppriate things, and so on. I am also not completely taken by the main character whom I find a bit annoying. But the good part is that you learn a lot about sake and the traditions that surround it. I would recommend this series to people interested in learning more about sake in an entertaining way.  Dans la combi de Thomas Pesquet (2017)   By Marion Montaigne In the same vibe as her other scientific vulgarization graphic novels, Montaigne does a great job explaining the astronaut life in  Dans la combi de Thomas Pesquet . We quickly realize that being an astronaut is not as glamourous as we may think. Reading this book makes you feel like you are visiting the secret NASA backstage ‚Äî worth it! {end-key}"},{ id: 21, directory: "Musings", title: "#28 On learning", subtitle: "Update #28", slug: "/posts/28-on-learning", dateCreated: "2023-03-24",  content: " Since we arrived in Ard√®che, I find it hard to keep up with this weeknote.

However, it will have to adapt to these new needs, to this new rhythm. Let's see how this evolves in the future months.  It is now 10PM, we are just back from the local astronomy club meeting. The members average age must be about 50-year-old. (Robin and I are definitely the youngest there.) The club was founded in 1993 ‚Äî practically my age. Members are quite active, but only few of them really know the sky. The most knowledgeable members were suggesting giving classes on how to manipulate the club telescopes and material. This really motivated me to get started with proactively learning the sky. I can already identify a few constellations, but would love to know more about their origin stories, the planets and stars, the physics rules that connect them all.  Talking about learning new things, I feel really inspired at the moment to  learn more . 3D modeling on Blender, the night sky, edible wild plants, gardening, driving. The motivation is there... but for how long? I know that these quick passions tend to die out. I might need to focus my energy on a few selected topics if I want to do some real progress.

I feel like so many things happened since last week. Heart-to-heart interview  First of all, I finally had my interview with three people from my current company. For the first time in my life, I have answered to these interview questions with 100% honesty. It felt quite liberating to be completely myself and not give half-truths that are more aligned with people expectations. An app to feel closer to your friends  Robin introduced our small group of friends to the  Cappuccino App . How does it work? Every day, you have the possibility to record one  bean  that will be mixed with the beans from your friends in a podcast-like format ‚Äî with background music and everything! You can also give prompts or ask questions if you don't like going on about your day. I love it. This app arrived right on time, as you currently don't have the possibility to meet your friends anymore. I love the fact that there is no possible small talk. No one is in front of you. You get straight to what is important. I feel like I have learned so much about my friends in just a few cappuccini. It is also true the other way around. I am usually quite reserved, but feel like talking about myself much more within these short 3 minutes. Reset of my digital garden  Middle of the week, I did it. I completely resetted my digital garden. I had first started it without much of a system. It rapidly got out of hands and began to feel chaotic and a bit overwhelming ‚Äî far from the thinking-buddy-second-brain-thingy I had imagined.

Getting back to work felt intense. The things I am currently working on are quite interesting, but I felt exhausted at the end of each day. I'm not complaining though, I only have 3-day-work weeks from now on until the end of my contract. 3-day-work weeks means that I have a lot of free time. I have many DIY projects I want to pursue  1  , but often feel blocked by one thing or another. For instance, finding the material is a big hurdle. It might be because I am trying to upcycle too much instead of just buying new raw material. Another hurdle is that the woodworking workshop is  right next to  the neighbors' house  2  . One of their doors actually connects to the workshop. I find myself tiptoeing and trying to make as little noise as possible whenever I go there. This makes it hard to use that room at all. I might need to be more patient and simply progress one step at a time, wherever I have control. These shelves, clothes hangers and curtain holders are not that urgent to build. Experiments  Making cereal bars  As the weather is getting better, we are doing more and more sporty outdoorsy activities. Whenever we have cereal bars at home, I usually bring them as snacks. For the first time last week, I tried making my own cereal bars. So far, I am not 100% convinced by the recipe I tried ‚Äî they were a bit too soft and didn't contain enough honey to my taste. However, I am pretty sure I can get it right after a few tries. I don't know why I didn't think of making these cereal bars earlier, as the ingredients are so simple  3  . Gardening  Robin did a lot of gardening work these last few weeks ‚Äî ¬†and I helped him here and there. I can already see that he is going to be the gardening-person out of us two. I do like it, but prefer the cooking-and-eating-the-veggies part.

We have now been in the area long enough to have developed a few routines. It was great being able to share some parts of this new life with friends from Berlin. Nothing fancy, but heartwarming nonetheless: a lot of gardening, reading, outdoor climbing, village hopping, wine drinking, cheese, sandwiches and cheese-sandwiches eating. I am now writing this weeknote as we are all on a train  1   from Valence to Berlin. This is the start of 4 weeks away from Ard√®che, our first time since we moved in. We are currently sitting across a four-year-old kid and his mother, and I just don't know how she does it. The level of patience and kindness she uses to deal with the little monster is insane.  2   Parenting seems like an exhausting full-time job, not sure whether I could do it. Read &#x26; Watched  A small streak of Becky Chambers  After one lunch discussion about sci-fi, I suddenly wanted to dive into something sci-fi-ish again. So I did. I went on and read two novellas by Becky Chambers back-to-back ‚Äî and I fell in love with her writing. The first novella is called  To Be Taught, If Fortunate  (2019) and is set in the 22nd century. Space exploration has been revolutionized as astronauts bodies can now adapt to their environments through a new biotechnology. The second novella,  A Psalm for the Wild-Built  (2021), is drastically different. It seems to be set in a far future, where humans left fifty percent of the world untouched and protected from human intervention. The singularity is also a thing of the past, robots have gained self-awareness and have now wandered off into the wilderness. The main characters of each novella could not be more different: the first one is an astronaut and the second one a monk. However, they also share a strong common trait: wherever they go, there is a will to leave a mark as small and temporary as possible, be it on another planet or just on a stretch of Earth soil. Sicilian night  As a taster of our Sicily trip in one week, we watched  The Godfather  directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is a three-hour-long movie from 1972, and  wow , it does deserve its classic label. I ‚Äî surprisingly ‚Äî really enjoyed the movie and didn't get bored at all.  Consiglio questo film!  Experiments  Dev  Robin and I have been working some more on our little side-project. We are creating our own private Pocket-like tool  3  . So far, we had been using  Hypothesis  a lot to annotate web pages. The highlighting and annotation experience is fairly good, but the tool is just not designed to bookmark future articles to-read. Other tools also exist, but they are either too expensive, not standardized enough  4  , or have a shitty reading / annotating experience. In the end, those  might be  are certainly excuses we use to just dive into yet another side-project. Gathering flowers  May is flower-month. In other words: time for thyme! When Jillian and Connor just arrived, we gathered a lot of flowering thyme around Balazuc. We let it dry for two weeks and spent approximately 1 million hours yesterday separating the flowers and seeds from the branches. It is a truly meditative experience, but be prepared to (1) use up the skin of your fingers, and (2) smell wonderful afterward. We also gathered some elderflowers from the garden. I tried to make an elderflower-pear pudding following  this recipe . It came out quite good, but almost too sweet and thick to my taste. Robin made some elderflower syrup that we are preciously keeping in the fridge until we come back from our month away. T(W)IL  I started to follow the  Typescript course by the codecademy . I feel like I have reached a comfortable level in JavaScript ‚Äî at least, comfortable for what I usually need to do with it. Hopefully, this course will help me feel a little bit less lost when needing to read some Typescript files. I'm also entertaining the idea of migrating my website to Typescript for practice.

Anyway, Robin and I just left Berlin yesterday after spending a little under one week at Jillian and Connor's place. Our first night there was both very familiar and completely foreign. We have surprisingly gotten used to our new countryside pace in just a few months. Our short Berlin trip was also synonymous with our last week of work.

Wow, we actually just learned that the Etna just erupted less than an hour ago. We tried to see the smoke, but are not sure we could distinguish it among the other clouds. There is such a special atmosphere in the air: the grey cloudy sky, the dark opaque and ink-like sea, the fresh breeze. It feels a bit like the ominous start of an apocalyptic movie.

The paint is made by mixing flour, color pigments, iron oxides, linseed oil, and a bit of black soap.

Getting creative with words  For a few years now, I have been writing on and off in my numerous diaries, travel journals, blogs, and so on. All of these projects are very down-to-earth, as I usually talk about lived experiences, current thoughts or future plans. I have been trying to bring back some creativity in my life in different ways. One of them is playing more with words and poetry. I published  my first try at it in a previous post (in French) .

First, we had to learn to climb a real mountain wall and get used to how varied rock types will feel different. Being used to bouldering only, our stamina was also challenged. After feeling comfortable climbing top rope, we practiced lead climbing again. And most importantly: lead falling. (I am still in the middle of properly learning that one.) Last week, we tried our first multi-pitch climbing ( Alien vs Predators , 50m). And this week, we directly went on with our second multi-pitch ( Biotone , 110m). Multi-pitch climbing adds a thick layer of new techniques to regular sport climbing. Suddenly, you have to be extremely organized with how you manage your rope and tools to make it to the top (and back to the bottom). It is not that much about performance climbing anymore, but more about planning and technicalities. I love how rich the world of climbing is and how far you can potentially go, if you are motivated enough.

Now, let's get started with the actual update.  Learning about fermentation  As you might have seen, I dove head first into the theory of  fermentation . What a fascinating and magical world! I think I need to read a bit more about it to have a more structured understanding of it. But I already feel like I have learned a lot and built a good foundation from just that Wikipedia browsing afternoon. To be continued... Building a bookshelf  Robin's parents came to visit a few weeks ago. We took advantage of Robin's father woodworking skills to build our bookshelf together. I love how it looks and am so happy to finally be able to store our books in a proper bookshelf  2  ! Learning Russian  So far, I managed to learn the Cyrillic alphabet. Robin and I took our first Russian lesson on italki with a Russian dude who speaks French fluently  3  . Our goal would be to have a basic understanding of Russian while traveling across Central Asia next year. Keeping up with all these fruits and veggies  Summer is amazing for fruits and veggies here. We almost don't buy any extra vegetables at the market nowadays, as our garden is providing us with new zucchini, eggplants, tomatoes, green beans (and more) every few days. The only problem is that we tend to have a lot of a few produces ‚Äî yep congrats, that's how seasonal veggies work, Clara. This really challenges my creativity, as I need to find diverse ways to eat the same vegetables every day. The same is true with fruits, as we have a lot of plums from the garden. We also buy some extra peaches, apricots, and melons from local farmers. The duration of a fruit season is usually quite limited, so it feels a bit like now or never. I love this abundance. Having too much of these fruits and veggies lead me to discover  zucchini soup ,  peach ice tea , zucchini terrine,  tomato and zucchini tarte tatin ,  gaspacho ,  fruit clafoutis , and more.  Otherwise, I'm thinking of redesigning my website (once again). I am getting bored of this minimalist black and white style. And ‚Äî let's be honest ‚Äî I just want to redesign it because it's fun.

To begin with, Robin's otitis evolved into a semi-facial paralysis. That was super scary. Thankfully, we now know for sure that the condition is benign and should pass with time. With that diagnosis in the background, we tried to go on with life and our regular activities. Activity #1: hiking  On Sunday, we went to St-Melany for the first time, driving on some of the most beautiful roads I have seen in Ard√®che. St-Melany also has an artist-themed hike that guides you through amazing landscapes. The only drawback is that the entire loop is 5‚Äì6 hours long. That hike is therefore the longest I have ever done (yes, I'm weak). I am happy to announce, that although I almost gave up in the middle, I still successfully completed the loop without crying. Plus, a great thing about doing that hike end of September is that we were able to nibble on lots of wild grapes on the way! Activity #2: eating nougat  On Monday, Robin had a doctor appointment in Mont√©limar, a legit (albeit small) city one hour drive away. So, we thought that it would be nice to spend the day there, doing some city-related activities. The idea was nice. The only problem was that it was a  Monday . And French cities are  dead  on Mondays. In short, all the nice restaurants, coffee shops, museums (nah, kidding), book stores, even libraries we wanted to visit were all closed (sob). But that's  fine , because Mont√©limar is a wonderful city where everything is under construction. I'll let you imagine how lovely the atmosphere was. [insert construction noises]  Okay , I'm making it sound worse than what it was. In reality, we stumbled upon a cute Vietnamese restaurant ‚Äî yes, one of the rare restaurants to be open. Bonus points: we also visited two nougat producers and brought back a lot of sweet edible souvenirs. We discovered  black nougat  that is made with mostly honey and as little sugar as possible. It's official, I can now never go back to regular white nougat. Activity #3: harvesting pepper  France planted a Sichuan pepper tree in her garden about ten years ago. This is now the second year the tree gives her enough flowers for a harvest. Yes, flowers and not fruits. When talking about Sichuan pepper, the name is misleading, as it is in fact not closely related to black pepper. Apparently, it's not the seeds that you dry and eat, but the flowers  1   that cover them. To harvest the pepper, cut some branches to bring back home. This part is already tricky as the branches  do not want to be touched . They are super spiky and will not hesitate to hurt you. Once home, separate the flowers from the branches. Wait for flowers to dry. We are now currently in the waiting phase.

Robin currently has a slight knee injury, so we were a bit limited in our activities: no climbing, swimming or hiking, but plenty of eating, wine tasting, village hopping, and library browsing. Here are some highlights:  Morning start at the caf√© in Saint-Jean-de-Bu√®ges, warm sweater, hot coffee and croissant Truly stunning church in St-Guilhem-Le-D√©sert, pond with carps in the inner garden, warm and quiet light Twisting roads lined with plane trees, sun rays piercing through, long shadows White wine at a wine bar terrace in S√®te, a plate of fresh oysters from the producer stall next door Sharing wine and a meal in Karima's flat in Montpellier, floor made of old flat stones Second-hand bookstore in P√©zenas, old beautiful books about oddly specific topics A winemaker and his wife in Minerve, his hands still full of dirt from the vineyard as we are savoring the wine Ice cream and coffee in the church square of Sauve, a fresh breeze in the late afternoon light   We met several people on the way ‚Äî always open, and friendly, often creative. From this short trip, I come back with the renewed motivation to make my own soap, knit something from A to Z, paint some more. Good thing that these are all winter-friendly activities. {end-key}"},{ id: 34, directory: "Musings", title: "#4 Gl√ºhwein and note-taking", subtitle: "Update #4", slug: "/posts/4-gluehwein-and-note-taking", dateCreated: "2020-11-28",  content: "    What To Consider When Considering Data Vis Rules  by Lisa Charlotte Ros   Life peek: Wholesome feelings after work  Being in semi-lockdown in Berlin feels both fast and slow.

Week after week, there are always a few highlights worth mentioning. Work wise, this last week was pretty intense for me: lots of Black Friday-related emergencies (ugh, marketing agencies) and the confirmation of my promotion to Senior Designer. After hectic days at work, Robin and I did what was left for us in a city half in lockdown: go for a walk in the cold and drink Gl√ºhwein. It seems like every coffee shop, bakery and restaurant has now started making its own mulled wine. Some are fruitier, some are spicier, some are just cheaper. I love them all. I love the contrast between the hot spicy drink, the warm lights and the cold evening weather. It gives me wholesome feelings. Read &#x26; Watched   How to Be Great?

Just a few weeks ago, we were still burning under the sun; but now, summer feels like a long-forgotten memory.

In the last few years, we have started to play a lot more, especially in board game caf√©s when traveling. Searching for board game caf√©s is actually on my to-do list whenever we discover a new city. Back to the board game festival, we arrived close to the end of the event but were able to play a few new games.  A two-person game to be played with dice, where the goal is to be the fastest player to find an itinerary between points A and Z. (Ok yeah, it's not clear at all. But I didn't  love  that game, so that's it.)  In the Footsteps of Darwin : A volunteer paired us with a family of three and started explaining the rules to us. Once you thought the list of rules was coming to an end, another one was added on top of it all. It was slightly overwhelming at first, but the game itself was actually  nice . It reminded me of  Azul , the mechanics encouraging you to create your little collection on your side, without being too openly agressive towards the other players. Overall: a relaxing game.  Quoridor : A beautiful game where your goal is to be the first to cross the board. Everyone also has small wooden walls that they can use to add obstacles on the paths of other players.  Twin it! poster : An A1 poster that you can use as a decoration... and mean of torture for your guests. It is filled with different (but very similar) patterns; your goal is to find five twin patterns. Good luck.  2    I got a new phone  ...or more like Robin got me one. He was doing some research for himself, and as I also needed a new phone  3  , we now have twin Samsung Galaxy S22 that we bought second-hand. A few things that convinced us to get that specific phone model is that:  It takes excellent pictures (which we thought would be extra-nice for our coming trip). Since the S22 model, Samsung guarantees 4 years of software updates (which is great). It is affordable in second-hand and not too old (so chances are that I won't need to replace it for longer). ...and other things Robin probably thought about.  Other things I did   I made my  first solid shampoo  a few days ago. I haven't tested it yet, but the process was much easier than I had expected! Once I had the ingredients ready (not that many, not that weird), the full recipe only took 20 minutes and simple kitchen equipment. I browsed for hours on  searchmysite.net , a search engine that only goes through personal websites, the small web, digital gardens and so on. Sites are ranked higher when they have no ads.

Our plan for the next few weeks: broaden our knowledge of classical music. Read &#x26; Watched   The Polymath Playbook   I had this article on my to-read list for quite some time, but only got to it this week.

In other words: the more we work, the more it pushes us to consume. The more we consume, the more we have to work to afford it.  The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake (article, 2020)   Fascinating article about why we envision the ideal family as two parents with 2.5 kids, and how the stable nuclear family isn't viable anymore.

Among many things, we went back to North Neuk√∂lln ‚Äî one of our favorite neighborhoods in Berlin. This time around, we slowly walked down the Sonnenallee, or the Arab street as some call it. In total: 38 minutes to walk from Hermannplatz to the Sonnenallee S-Bahn station. As we leave Hermannplatz, we first stop at  Al Faisal Grills and Restaurant , a Syrian joint that is always full. We grab a  manousheh  for two to share on the way. With zaatar and olive oil dripping on our fingers, we get deeper and deeper into the street. Store signs transition from German to Arabic only, Halal butchers appear here and there, people around us are speaking Arabic first and foremost. Our second stop is at  Akroum Snack , a tiny restaurant that you might miss if you are not paying attention. We order a  fatteh  to share, and it is honestly the best fatteh I know of: creamy, generous, topped with thin and super crispy pieces of fried pita. As we are waiting for our order, we get the usual Arabic tea served in these types of restaurants (self-service style):  Take a glass. Pour a few centimeters of black tea from tap 1. Fill the rest of your glass with hot water from tap 2. Add a generous amount of sugar. Mix, taste and adjust ingredients if necessary.  Our order arrives, and we walk to a table to the back of the restaurant. From there, Robin has a good viewpoint on the rest of the restaurant. Thanks to that perfect viewpoint, we learn a new fatteh-eating technique! When eating fatteh, we used to overfill our pita breads with it, always making a mess. Robin has now observed that  some people  take a small piece of pita, shape it like a cone, fill that cone with fatteh and eat it all in one single bite. Tested and immediately adopted. At that point, our bellies already feel quite full (we had eaten breakfast not so long ago). We stop at supermarket stalls on the way, looking at the products displayed: grape leaves in jars, instant noodles with an Arabic branding, hummus sold in cartons, giant bags of dried coral lentils, trays of dried dates, all kinds of BBQ related products (coal, gas, grills). Oh wait, we track back a few steps for a final sweet stop. We have never noticed this pastry shop before:  Malek Al Konafeh . They specialize in  kunafeh , a dessert made with spun pastry, soaked in sweet syrup, layered with cheese and pistachio. We take our sweet and cheesy dessert and savor it at a table right outside the shop. It fills whatever space was left in our bellies. As we eat, we observe whatever is happening on the street. Cars honking, one small red car stopping in the middle of the street, the driver comes out and changes his license plate. We draw some more sweet cheesy strings from our aluminum plate to our mouths. Some drivers get out of their cars and are now discussing in the middle of the street. A big white car comes out of a parking space, immediately replaced by the small red car. The red car driver replaces his license plate with a new one once again ‚Äî it is put on upside down. Almost bursting, we continue our walk down Sonnenallee: shops selling wedding dresses and hijabs, pastry shops selling giant colorful cakes and baklava, gold jewelry stores, D√∂ner joints, shops displaying shiny home decor items. As we get closer to Sonnenallee station, the street chaos seems to tame down, there are fewer people, more space, less noise. But the true end of the Arab street might be marked by the clothing store specialized in techno rave outfits ‚Äî mostly skimpy black leather clothes that look like bikinis. We do a final stop as we arrive at the Sonnenallee station. We order a filter coffee and a flat white in a familiar hipster coffee shop. Students and young professionals are sitting at various tables, some are wearing beanies, thick black leather boots, most are working on their laptops. From there, we see and hear the S-Bahn run by.

Today, I'll show you how to easily bring your creations to life with a crayon effect, using Adobe Illustrator only. Let's get started! üöÄ   Before > after   Step 1  Open a copy of your original vector illustration in Adobe Illustrator. (Wouldn't want any accident happening, right? üòò) Step 2  Open the  Brushes  panel ( Window > Brushes ) and check  Show Art Brushes  in the panel menu.   Select your favorite brush!

(So many brushes! üñå)   Repeat for all the vector strokes you'd like to convert into brush strokes.     Step 3  In this example, I'd like to add a brush stroke around the face to define it better. To do so, begin by making a copy of the face shape layer (here called skin).   Copy of the skin layer     Swap the swatches   With the layer selected, convert the shape into a stroke by swapping the Fill and Stroke swatches ( Shift + X ). You now have your outlining stroke! (Yaay üéâ) Feel free to edit the color and line weight to see it better. Step 4 (Optional)  Let's say you don't want your newly created stroke to completely outline the face shape (because that would just look weird). Let's see how we can manage to have a clear hairline at the top with ‚úÇ Use the  Scissors  tool ( C ) to cut two endpoints on your stroke to delete that unwanted upper stroke.   ‚úÇ Select endpoint #1‚Ä¶     ‚Ä¶and endpoint #2     See? No more stroke!   Once you have your final stroke, convert it as previously done (Step 2) into a brush stroke. Step 5  Add some details to your illustration to bring it to life. Here, I've added definition to the hair and pink to the cheeks. And I got this flawless self-portrait as a result üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   So flawless.

I have also learned that so many of the things I drink or eat are in fact fermented ‚Äî think cheese, wine, beer, yogurt, bread. Since Wednesday, I have been diving deep into the intricate world of fermentation from a complete other direction. I stepped outside my comfort zone and had a look at this whole fermentation shenanigan from the point of view of biochemistry. Here are the things I've learned.  (Disclaimer: I am mostly quoting Wikipedia as that's where my fermentation rabbit hole started. Please  get back to me  if I wrote anything wrong-I-don't-really-know-what-I'm-talking-about.)   What is fermentation?  In biochemistry,  fermentation  is the process where living organisms extract energy from carbohydrates (e.g. starch or sugar) in the absence of oxygen. The food industry sets a broader scope, as it is more largely defined as a metabolic process that produces chemical changes in organic substances through the action of enzymes. There are tons of different fermentation processes that can produce a number of things: alcohol (a.k.a. ethanol), acid, carbon dioxide, and others. For instance, yeasts are used in wine and beer-making to produce alcohol, while bacteria are used for yogurts to produce acid. Sometimes, a mix of both yeasts and bacteria can be used in tandem as well. Let's have a look at a few types of fermentation used in the food-industry ‚Äî because who cares about the other types anyway.  1   Lacto fermentation   Lacto fermentation , also called  lactic acid fermentation , is the process where lactic acid bacteria (LAB) convert sugars into energy, with lactic acid (and sometimes other stuff as well) as by-products. This occurs in an anaerobic environment  2  . Common examples of lacto fermentation are kimchi, Sauerkraut or yogurt. LAB already naturally exists in many vegetables, so you don't need to add external bacteria for the fermentation to occur. The bacteria keep on living in the final product and make them  probiotic , which is good your gut health. Let's use the  Sauerkraut recipe  as an example. At its simplest, you only need to mix cabbage with water and let it rest at room temperature to kickstart the fermentation process. Notice how the recipe insists on preventing the minced cabbage from coming in contact with the air. The reason is to keep the environment anaerobic, where LAB thrive whereas other *bad bacteria* would die. As the fermentation goes, all the glucose present in the cabbage is transformed into lactic acid, making Sauerkraut sour. Another example of lacto fermentation is cheese. The basic concept of cheese is to divide milk into solid curds and liquid whey. To do so, we need to either add an acid element to the milk (e.g. vinegar) or mix in LAB that will consume the lactose and transform it into lactic acid.  3   Ethanol fermentation   Ethanol fermentation  or  alcoholic fermentation  is the process where yeasts ‚Äî a.k.a. mushrooms ‚Äî convert sugars into energy in an anaerobic environment (same old, same old). However, this time, the by-products are ethanol and carbon dioxide. In the case of food, ethanol makes things ‚Äî well ‚Äî alcoholic, whereas carbon dioxide produces bubbles. In short, this type of fermentation is used for wines, beers, whiskeys, rums and tons of other alcoholic beverages. In most cases, the brewers will let the carbon dioxide escape during a primary fermentation. When needed, a second fermentation (sometimes with extra yeast) can be done in the final bottle. As the carbon dioxide doesn't have anywhere to go, it is integrated into the liquid as bubbles ‚Äî yay! Beers and sparkly wines are perfect examples of this second fermentation. With ethanol fermentation, the yeasts die after a while: either when all the sugars have been converted into ethanol or when the alcohol content has reached 15% alcohol per unit volume ‚Äî strong enough to kill all types of yeasts. When a beer is unfiltered, you can see the sediment of dead yeasts remaining at the bottom of the bottle. Winemakers also use this yeast property to make fortified wines (e.g. Porto wine). They can stop the fermenting process by adding some extra alcohol in wine. This usually results in a sweeter and stronger wine. The fermenting process can also be stopped by simply dropping the temperature of the tank.  Fun fact: ethanol fermentation also takes place in some species of fish where it provides energy when oxygen is scarce.  Malolactic fermentation   Malolactic fermentation  is a process in winemaking. It is usually done after the first ethanol fermentation, by introducing LAB into the must. Those bacteria will consume the tart-tasting malic acid, naturally present in grape must, and produce softer-tasting lactic acid and carbon dioxide. The final aromas are said to be less acid, apple-like and more buttery, milky, oily or vanilla-like. Most red wines undergo malolactic fermentation, as well as some rounder white wines like Chardonnay. LAB can be very sensitive to the sulfites (sulfur dioxide) added during the winemaking process. When choosing to not use sulfites, wild LAB native to the grapes can initiate uncontrolled malolactic fermentation that might give an off-taste to some natural wines. Carbonic maceration   Carbonic maceration  is a fermentation technique usually used for specific types of wines (e.g. Beaujolais). It results in wines with low tannins that should be drunk young. It actually falls under the ethanol fermentation family. The difference is that instead of crushing the grapes, most of the fruits are kept whole in a sealed container. The fruits at the bottom are crushed¬≠ ‚Äî because of  duh  gravity ‚Äî and undergo conventional ethanol fermentation. The carbon dioxide produced saturates the air, creating an anaerobic environment  4  . The carbon dioxide gas stimulates the fermentation process, which occurs inside of each berry. Carbonic maceration started as a winemaking technique, but people have started using it during coffee preprocessing as well. Before the coffee berries are ready to be roasted, they need to first be fermented, so that the fruit pulp can be removed from the seed. The method is similar: keep the berries intact in a closed vessel to undergo a carbonic maceration. In the case of coffee, the vessel is pumped with extra carbon dioxide to begin with. The resulting coffee profiles are often described as more intense. Aerobic fermentation   Aerobic fermentation  is the process where acetic acid bacteria (AAB) metabolize sugars or ethanol in an aerobic environment  5  . Its by-product is acetic acid. As there is oxygen involved, it is more accurate to call this fermentation an  oxidation  process. This type of fermentation is used for the production of vinegar. If making wine vinegar, the ethanol present in the wine is converted into acetic acid. This is also why we usually use sulfites in the winemaking process. Sulfites prevent oxidation, thus avoiding the wine transforming into vinegar. Special mention: SCOBY  A SCOBY is a  symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast . It is a culinary fermentation culture (or starter) where we find both yeasts and bacteria living in harmony ‚Äî isn't it beautiful? Common examples of food / drinks made from a SCOBY are kombucha, kefir, sourdough bread, vinegar, soy sauce or sour beers. A SCOBY is a mix of yeast, LAB, and AAB. The SCOBY, when mixed with water and sugar-rich ingredients, undergo multiple types of fermentation and oxidation. To be completely honest, I haven't fully understood what ferments what and when. But all in all, yeasts consume sugars and produce ethanol. The LAB are anaerobic, consume sugars and produce lactic acid. The AAB are aerobic, consume either sugars or ethanol and produce acetic acid.  That's it for today's episode on food fermentation! I might update it in the future, as I learn more about this fascinating world! {end-key}  Footnotes    Actually, fermentation also occurs in other super interesting cases. For instance, during intense exercise, Mammalian muscles will undergo fermentation and transform some of those stored sugars into energy and lactic acid as a by-product. I now finally understand why my arms hurt after an intense climbing session!  ‚Ü©   An anaerobic environment has no oxygen.  ‚Ü©   A lot of cheeses are also made with rennet, a set of enzymes, that will also divide the milk into curds and whey. The bonus effect is that the curds will be less fragile and more gel-like.  ‚Ü©   Carbon dioxide is heavier than oxygen.

Since then, I remember starting a project or two, but never completing them. Fast-forward to January 2023, I finally find a reason to have a typography pet project. Robin and I wanted to bring our shared blog  Eau de poisson  back to life. In our usual knowing-how-to-prioritize fashion, we decided to first reformat and redesign the entire website. And for that, we needed a new font. A font that was casual and laid back, but that would also support Latin-extended characters ‚Äî mostly French, Vietnamese and other major Latin languages. The existing  Gaegu  typeface would have been perfect. However, it was mostly created for Korean and didn't support Latin-Extended characters. So, I decided to create my own typeface, shamelessly taking inspiration from Gaegu, but making sure to include all the characters I needed. For a first font creation, I'll give myself some leeway and say it's okay. The creative process  I don't really know if professionals could use Fontself. I somehow doubt it. Yet, for non-precise amateur work, it made the entire process super easy! 1. Draw your glyphs  You first need to install the Fontself plugin in Illustrator or Photoshop (I have the Illustrator plugin). From there, you can use Fontself's character grid template, or you can also create your own.   You then get into the heart of the process, either hand drawing your glyphs or using the pen tool for pixel perfect work. I drew mine with my graphic tablet, making sure to follow the guides.  1     2. Optimize your work  Once you completed your character set, make sure to duplicate it to optimize it.  Transform all strokes into shapes. ( Object > Expand appearance ) Merge all parts of one character into one group. ( Pathfinder > Unite ) For a better performance, I also simplified all the shapes, while preserving enough details. ( Right-click > Simplify... )  3. Upload your characters on Fontself  You can then upload all your characters into the plugin. You will get an overview like this.   In this first screen, you check that your characters are all on the same baseline, and that the ascender and descender are correctly positioned. You make these edits by dragging the characters and guides directly. 4. Save hours of work with one click  We now get to the cool part:   In only one click, Fontself will go through your entire character set and do the base spacing / kerning work automatically. The letters g, j, or i usually have a smaller left-margin? The plugin will calculate and preset that margin for you. Of course, the result is by far not perfect, but it does save you a lot of time! Once Fontself has done most of your work,... you still have a lot to do. Here comes the manual spacing and kerning part of the process. 5. Spacing and kerning, the manual way   What is the difference between spacing and kerning? When we talk about a font's spacing, we are referring to the generic amount of space between the characters. This sets the font rhythm. We refer to kerning to talk about the adjustment of space between two specific characters.  Fontself gives you control glyphs that define the rhythm of your font. Traditionally, we use  nnnnn  and  ooooo  for lowercase,  HHHHH  and  OOOOO  for uppercase. As you scroll down, you compare the usual  ooooo  rhythm with an extra glyph in the middle. You can then adjust the spacing around these glyphs to fit the rhythm you settled for. Make sure you spend most of your time on the spacing before getting to kerning. The process should then be fairly similar. The only difference being that you adjust a space between two specific glyphs only.      And that's it! It took me a day and a half to finish, even though I made the simplest font I could think of. I am really happy with the result, even though it doesn't produce the most legible body text ‚Äî but who cares, I only use it for headings. Anyway. {end-key}  Footnotes    Pay extra attention to the top (ascender) and bottom (descender) guides, not going beyond them, as it might ruin the final font line-height.  ‚Ü©   "},{ id: 60, directory: "Musings", title: "In Bruges (2008)", subtitle: "A tiny note about the movie", slug: "/posts/in-bruges-2018", dateCreated: "2020-12-19",  content: "  Directed by Martin McDonagh  Super funky characters, really liked the movie!

And as it usually happens, I dived head first into it before he even had time to close his tabs. I remember struggling quite a bit with the concepts, as the documentation is a bit messy and the standards are overall loosely applied by the community. All in all, I wasn't so successful in getting any closer to the IndieWeb grail. But what is the IndieWeb to begin with?  Chris Aldrich explains it way better than I could in his  introduction to the IndieWeb . But to keep things short, it is a movement that is built on three main principles:  Ownership of your content ‚Äî No vendor lock-in as you publish and own your content. Author centric ‚Äî You can be connected to other services and platforms, but everything comes back to your site. Control of your content and format ‚Äî You completely control how your website looks and works.  After my recent  website redesign , I decided to have another go at this IndieWeb stuff. And I think I was a bit more successful this time around. IndieWeb baby steps...   ...a guide by someone who didn't understand half of what she did.  If you are completely new to this world, I absolutely recommend reading the  introduction to the IndieWeb  mentioned before. It really helped me get the why the IndieWeb part pinned down. On the side, it is also always good to have a look at the official  IndieWeb Getting Started page . Most documentation is available there. So what about some concrete steps, now?  Domain name ‚Äî First of all, you will need to own your domain name to set up most of the IndieWeb stuff we'll talk about.  Wiki: how to get your domain name.  Web sign in ‚Äî Something that is pretty common in IndieWeb circles is to enable login to services with your domain name alone.  Wiki: how to set up web sign in.  Join the IndieWeb webring ‚Äî Once you have a web sign in setup, you are ready to join the  IndieWeb webring ! Or at least, I would highly recommend browsing through the ring ‚Äî start at the  footer of my homepage  ‚Äî to see how all of these standards are applied by real websites. Mark up your content ‚Äî Use  microformats  to mark up your content and enable a ton of IndieWeb features in the future. I started with an   h-card   (or profile card) on my homepage, as well adding microformats to my blog posts. Enabling webmentions ‚Äî After months, Rowan Manning's article   Webmentions for your Static Site   finally clarified for me what webmentions were all about. I went for the simplest setup, using  webmention.io  to receive webmentions and  Telegraph  to manually send them.  If you are still confused after reading the many wikis and articles, feel free to have a look at my homepage markup. It definitely helped me to compare the documentation to some real life examples. Another good link to have open on the side at all times is  IndieWebify.me  that will give you a few starting tips and allow you to test some of your setups. Now that everything  seems  to be technically viable, the question that remains is: How do I really want to use these tools? {end-key}"},{ id: 66, directory: "Musings", title: "My quest for true small caps", subtitle: "A web design adventure", slug: "/posts/my-quest-for-true-small-caps", dateCreated: "2021-01-07",  content: "  Note: this article is based on the previous design of my website.   When I launched my website with Next.js, I naturally veered towards a minimal typography-based design. The idea seemed simple to implement, yet elegant. Nothing could go wrong. My first version looked fine: white on dark gray, big bold headings and a more discreet sans serif body. But I wanted to add some  spice . This was going to be my personal website, and it needed to have something special. How about changing links to something else? Maybe small caps? And there began my quest to find true small caps on the web. Challenge #1: Finding typefaces with small caps  It is hard finding an open source typeface that actually supports small caps. This actually made things easier for me, as I was already planning to spend hours trying out different typefaces. I knew I wanted a simple sans serif typeface to complement the quirky Vesper Libre of my headings. Only one sans serif font was open source with small caps support: Source Sans Pro. My choice was made. Challenge #2: Are those really true small caps?  Mmh... are those true small caps or fake ones? Honestly, I wasn't sure. Red flag: the supposedly small caps did look thinner than the regular letters.    Before: fake small caps     After: true small caps  What saved me was this (amazing looking)  blog post on small caps . I didn't go through everything explained there, but I learned that small caps actually have Unicode characters. I could now have  actual true small caps  next to my maybe true small caps and see if they differed. They did.  Shoot . Challenge #3: Setting up true small caps  I dived into the small caps rabbit hole again and realized that small caps ‚Äî and other special glyphs ‚Äî were only supported by the OpenType format (OTF). That explained a lot as I was using the WOFF and WOFF2 formats so far. I was hesitant to switch to an OTF font as the WOFF format is made for the web and loads  much  faster. I settled on an in-between decision by keeping both of them. My main font would remain in WOFF / WOFF2, while I would load the small caps from the OTF file. I basically treated my main font and small caps as two distinct font families. For reference, here is the  @font-face  code I used for my small caps characters:  @font-face {   font-family: SourceSansProSmallCaps;   src: url(/fonts/SourceSansPro-Regular.otf) format(opentype);   font-weight: 400;   font-style: normal;   font-display: swap; /* Avoids blank space while loading  */   unicode-range: U+000-2AF; /* Download small caps ranges only */ }    Let's dive into the details:   font-display: swap  means that the block time is short for an infinite swap period. Your computer might take a tiny moment to load your small caps. This line of code avoids having a blank space where your small caps should be during that time.  unicode-range: U+000-2AF  loads the IPA Extensions Unicode range only ‚Äî that's where the small caps are.  And that's how I managed to set up true small caps on my website. Anyway. {end-key}"},{ id: 67, directory: "Musings", title: "Now archive #1", subtitle: "A snapshot in time", slug: "/posts/now-archive-1", dateCreated: "2021-08-21",  content: " Now in Berlin for more than two years with my partner  Robin .

I had already read the book a few years ago and remembered loving it. As I was practically in a dying state, it seemed like it would have just the kind of wholesome vibe I needed. Plus, I was curious about how an audio version of this epistolary novel would fare. So I closed my eyes and pressed on  play  (or more likely the other way around). And what an adventure! I wholeheartedly recommend listening to the  Penguin Random House edition of the audiobook . The voice actors are able to give life to the many characters in such a natural way, it is hard to believe that it is only a five-people cast. There is something about this novel and these characters that just made me want to start over, as soon as I had finished it. Listening to it feels like sitting in a cozy armchair with a cat on your laps, drinking hot chocolate out of your favorite heavy ceramic mug with jazz music in the background.  2   In short,  The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society  made me feel like I was part of a quirky, loving and caring community.

Let's be clear, neither planets or stars really twinkle. The difference in scintillation will be explained by how big the objects are seen from Earth. Stars appear as dots, whereas planets appear as discs. (Because stars are much farther than planets, they also appear smaller.) The light coming from a star will be refracted in many directions when going through our turbulent atmosphere. It will make it look like it is scintillating. On the contrary, the light coming from a planet and going through our atmosphere will seem more stable as its extra surface will allow it to compensate the variations. 3. Where is it positioned?  All planets follow the  ecliptic plane  as all planets rotate around the sun.

It enables plants to absorb light to power the plant. It also has a side effect: it gives the plant its green color. Chlorophyll molecules aren't very stable molecules. They can break down or change configuration quite easily, which can change their color. Acidity, heat, and damage can also impact chlorophyll molecules, and thus the color of your green food. Blanching brightens your veggies  The chlorophyll is present  inside  the plant, in its cells. When blanching, the gases trapped between the tissue's cell escape, the cell walls collapse and the chlorophyll becomes more visible. Heat also plays a second role: it destroys a plant enzyme called chlorophyllase, which is responsible for breaking down the chlorophyll pigment into a brown color. However, if vegetables are cooked too long, their bright green transforms into a dull olive gray. The prolonged heating causes the cells to release acids. These push out the magnesium atom in the center of the chlorophyll molecule, causing it to turn dull green. When cooking, we should then avoid adding acids (e.g. lemon, vinegar) to blanching water. On the opposite, adding a pinch of baking soda can help retain some of the bright green color. Alkalines will indeed counteract the plant acids dulling effect. Note: This is also the reason why lactic fermentation of green veggies will make their color duller."},{ id: 94, directory: "Learning", title: "Food pigments: Purple, blue or red blueberries", slug: "/learning/cooking-3-food-pigments-purple-blue-or-red-blueberries", dateCreated: "2023-09-30",  content: " Anthocyanins give their purple color to fruits and vegetables such as blueberries, pomegrenates, grapes or purple beans.

When the pH is high enough, as when making blueberry pie with lemon juice, the anthocyanins stabilyze into a red hue. When the pH is more alkaline, the hue will tend to be on the blue side.

If it is important that specific elements be read before others, these elements should be highlighted visually so that the reader's gaze is drawn to them first. Highlighting key details is also justified by the fact that it makes it easy for the reader to understand which of the features in the graphic are the most essential. (p. 90)  Note: For instance, a big central image can act as a focal point. Integrate text and graphics   In an eye-tracking study conducted at Lund University, the subjects were presented with newspaper spreads that had identical content, with the text and graphics laid out in different ways. [...] The study also looked at an alternative,  integrated  layout, in which the graphic elements were placed withing the text column, so that the teext and graphics that are related in content were located close to each other. When a page was laid out like this, readers read both the body text and the related graphics. This solution places less cognitive strain on the readers, because they do not have to form mnemonic links between the text and the separate graphics. (p. 90)  Nominal v. ordinal scales   A nominal scale divides items into classes, the only relevant characteristic of which is that they are separate. They have no particular order or distance on the scale. Examples of such classes include nationality, profession, membership in a certain group, and so on. [...] Values on a nominal scale cannot be mathematically compared. [...] An ordinal scale differs from the nominal scale in that the classes have a rank order: the first to tenth income decile, the Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, etc.), a ranking in comparison or competition, a military rank, and so on. It is possible to determine the median value for items on an ordinal scale, and to calculate the difference between two rankings, but because the scale does not say anything about the  magnitude  of differences between classes, most other calculations are not meaningful.

Basically: mix everything in a  bain-marie  and knead your mixture by hand with the essential oils. Too many essential oil drops; I would bring it down to max 20 drops. Would mixing only the SCI with the oil first help to melt it completely? Using a solid spoon could help to break it down as well.

Un nuage est en m√©t√©orologie une masse visible constitu√©e initialement d'une grande quantit√© de gouttelettes d‚Äôeau (parfois de cristaux de glace associ√©s √† des a√©rosols chimiques ou des min√©raux) en suspension dans l‚Äôatmosph√®re au-dessus de la surface d'une plan√®te. Comment se forme un nuage ?  Prenez un volume d'air satur√© de vapeur d'eau (invisible). Reroidissez cet air (a.k.a. la pression baisse), une partie de la vapeur d'eau pr√©sente dans l'air se condense, on voit appara√Ætre un nuage. Un nuage peut se former de diff√©rentes fa√ßons :  Par convection : L'air satur√© prend de l'altitude par convection. La pression diminue et il y a de donc plus de condensation et de nuages. Par soul√®vement orographique : Un nuage peut aussi se former lorsque l'air satur√© rencontre un relief (qui monte), suit sa courbe et se refroidit donc. Par contact avec une terre froide : Par exemple, lorsque l'air chaud et humide de la mer rencontre une c√¥te froide. L'air se refroidit et se condence. Par soul√®vement frontal : Un front d'air chaud rencontre un front d'air froid. Il se soul√®ve et peut former des nuages.  La forme des nuages  La forme d'un nuage est surtout d√©termin√©e par la stabilit√© de l'air qui l'entoure.  Air ambiant stable : Une masse d'air, humide et plus chaude que l'air ext√©rieur stable, va se soulever. Elle va monter et baisser en temp√©rature jusqu'au moment o√π sa temp√©rature va √©galiser celle de l'air ambiant. Pas tr√®s haut en altitude, le nuage va donc s'arr√™ter de monter, s'affaisser, s'allonger pour former un nuage  stratiforme . Air ambiant instable : Une masse d'air, humide et plus chaude que l'air ext√©rieur instable (forts mouvements d'air verticaux), va √©galement se soulever. √Ä la diff√©rence du premier cas, l'air ambiant instable va descendre en temp√©rature plus rapidement en montant en altitude. La masse d'air a donc plus de chemin √† parcourir pour atteindre un point d'√©quilibre des temp√©ratures. Le nuage form√© est bourgeonnant et  cumuliforme .  Les nuages stratiformes auront donc tendance √† se former plus proches du sol, jusqu'√† environ 7¬†km d'altitude. Les nuages cumuliformes peuvent quant √† eux s'√©tendre verticalement jusqu'√† environ 20¬†km d'altitude. Au bout du compte, la diff√©rence entre la formation de diff√©rents types de nuages ‚Äã‚Äãest due aux temp√©ratures de condensation. Certains nuages ‚Äã‚Äãse forment √† des temp√©ratures plus √©lev√©es et d'autres √† des temp√©ratures plus basses. Plus la temp√©rature de la formation est basse, plus le nuage sera √©pais. Certains types de nuages ‚Äã‚Äãproduisent √©galement des pr√©cipitations, d'autres non. Si la temp√©rature est trop basse, le nuage qui se forme sera constitu√© de cristaux de glace."},{ id: 105, directory: "Learning", title: "Russian: Duolingoing", slug: "/learning/russian-1-duolingoing", dateCreated: "2023-09-29",  content: " Sooo I've been Duolingoing Russian for approximately a month now.
