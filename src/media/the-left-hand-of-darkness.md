Ursula K. Le Guin first introduced the Hainish universe through three very short novels: <cite>Rocannon's World</cite>, <cite>Planet of Exile</cite>, and <cite>City of Illusions</cite>. They paint the first strokes of this universe, where all kinds of aliens collaborate through the League.

In this universe, we follow Genly Ai, an envoy from the League, whose mission is to invite a new world to this interplanetary club.

Le Guin is brilliant at hinting at an entire universe, while focusing her story on individual people. We are as Genly, culturally lost (and shocked?) on this world where gender doesn't exist and Winter is permanent.

Some aspects of the book feel a bit dated: the gender-related images Genly refers to seem to come straight from Earth in the sixties â€“ which they do. But the wonder of discovering this new world is timeless.

I liked the first three books, but can only agree with everyone: <cite>The Left Hand of Darkness</cite> is the culminating point, the jewel in the box.
