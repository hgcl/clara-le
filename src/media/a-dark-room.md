<a href="https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">A dark room</a> is a minimalist text adventure that starts with the simple act of lighting a fire. Little by little, the world expands, and develops into an addictive resource-gathering kind of game.

The creators are from Doublespeak, a small independent game studio focused on open source, browser based experiences. Even better, anyone can contribute to the evolution of this free and online game!

Only open the link if you have time to spare. I got swept into this game for five hours straight, as I just wanted to "check it out quickly".
