The story takes place in the 13th century, as Genghis Khan has united the Mongolian clans, and is going to war against the Western Xia dynasty.

We follow a Xia soldier, whose unit has been completely massacred by the Mongols. She is now seeking revenge against all Mongols — feared and known amongst them as _Shut Hell_.

This manga series is about adventure, friendship, sacrifice (and truly beautiful action scenes).
