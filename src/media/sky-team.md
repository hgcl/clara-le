<cite>Sky Team</cite> is a 2-person cooperative game, which is perfect, as (1) it's usually Robin and I playing, and (2) neither of us likes to lose.

There are many coop games out there, but TBH, they rarely meet our expectations. They are fun for one or two rounds, but not many more.

<cite>Sky Team</cite> started out like one of those games. You are a plane pilot with their copilot, trying to successfully fly and land their plane. To do that, you have a variety of different toggles, actions, and stuff you can do in a limited amount of time.

We processed these slightly complex mechanics in one easy-ish round. If it had been _just that_, the game would have been quite boring. However, there are many "extensions" included in the box. They add more layers and complexity to the base mechanics, which results in a very interesting game.

I love the fact that the mechanics of the game _make sense_ for the story. It is also quite smart how the base game was made to be easier to learn, so that complexity could be added with these extensions.
