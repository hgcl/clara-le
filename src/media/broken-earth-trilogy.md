Wowowow, this might be my favorite fantasy series ever!

> A SEASON OF ENDINGS HAS BEGUN.
>
> IT STARTS WITH THE GREAT RED RIFT across the heart of the world's sole continent, spewing ash that blots out the sun.
>
> IT STARTS WITH DEATH, with a murdered son and a missing daughter.
>
> IT STARTS WITH BETRAYAL and long-dormant wounds rising up to fester.
>
> This is the Stillness, a land familiar with catastrophe, where the power of the earth is wielded as a weapon. And where there is no mercy.
