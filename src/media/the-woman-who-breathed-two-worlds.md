This was my first Malaysian book, read when traveling through Penang, Taiping and Ipoh (Malaysia) in 2024. The characters are so full of life that I couldn't help getting invested in their day-to-day worries and joys.

I wrote more about it in [Eau de poisson](https://eaudepoisson.com/medias/the-woman-who-breathed-two-worlds/) (in French).
