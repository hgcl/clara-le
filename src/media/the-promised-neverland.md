It's been a very long time I haven't read a manga series. This 20-volume adventure, set in a dystopian (and fantastical) world, completely hooked me. It reminded me a bit of the novel <cite>Never Let Me Go</cite> written by Kazuo Ishiguro, but meant for a younger audience.

If you like young adult literature and dystopian stories, this series is for you.
