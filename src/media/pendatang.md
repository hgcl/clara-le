Amazed by this Malaysian crowdfunded dystopian movie. Cherry on the cake, they made it completely free to watch [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI50AwTDpiU).

> Set in a dystopian Malaysia in which different races are forbidden to mix. A Chinese family moves into their new house to find a scared Malay girl still hiding in it. Should they get rid of her or try to smuggle her back to safety?
