### Focal points guide the eyes

> With the use of focal points, the designer can introduce linear features into an open narrative structure. If it is important that specific elements be read before others, these elements should be highlighted visually so that the reader's gaze is drawn to them first. Highlighting key details is also justified by the fact that it makes it easy for the reader to understand which of the features in the graphic are the most essential. (p. 90)

Note: For instance, a big central image can act as a focal point.

### Integrate text and graphics

> In an eye-tracking study conducted at Lund University, the subjects were presented with newspaper spreads that had identical content, with the text and graphics laid out in different ways. [...]
>
> The study also looked at an alternative, _integrated_ layout, in which the graphic elements were placed withing the text column, so that the teext and graphics that are related in content were located close to each other. When a page was laid out like this, readers read both the body text and the related graphics. This solution places less cognitive strain on the readers, because they do not have to form mnemonic links between the text and the separate graphics. (p. 90)

### Nominal v. ordinal scales

> A nominal scale divides items into classes, the only relevant characteristic of which is that they are separate. They have no particular order or distance on the scale. Examples of such classes include nationality, profession, membership in a certain group, and so on. [...] Values on a nominal scale cannot be mathematically compared. [...]
>
> An ordinal scale differs from the nominal scale in that the classes have a rank order: the first to tenth income decile, the Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, etc.), a ranking in comparison or competition, a military rank, and so on. It is possible to determine the median value for items on an ordinal scale, and to calculate the difference between two rankings, but because the scale does not say anything about the _magnitude_ of differences between classes, most other calculations are not meaningful. (p. 94)
