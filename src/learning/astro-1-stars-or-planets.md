Here are three quick ways to differentiate a planet from a star.

### 1. How bright is it?

Sometimes, the object is just too bright to be a star. Venus is the brightest planet. It usually appears close to the morning sun or sunset.

### 2. Does it scintillate?

Let's be clear, neither planets or stars really twinkle. The difference in scintillation will be explained by how big the objects are seen from Earth. Stars appear as dots, whereas planets appear as discs. (Because stars are much farther than planets, they also appear smaller.)

The light coming from a star will be refracted in many directions when going through our turbulent atmosphere. It will make it look like it is scintillating.

On the contrary, the light coming from a planet and going through our atmosphere will seem more stable as its extra surface will allow it to "compensate" the variations.

### 3. Where is it positioned?

All planets follow the _ecliptic plane_ as all planets rotate around the sun. As Earth is also rotating around the sun, it will seem like all planets (and the moon) are following the imaginary trajectory traced by the sun.
