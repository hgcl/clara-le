Sooo I've been Duolingoing Russian for approximately a month now. Compared to other Duolingo languages, the Russian course is really bad. For me, the main issue is that we are missing some grammar notes or simple explanations for each lesson.

Well, the internet heard my plea and provided. The [Duonotes wiki offers context](https://duonotes.fandom.com/wiki/Russian) for the Russian Duolingo course!

I am going to review that wiki and copy-paste the parts I find interesting or would like to remember.
