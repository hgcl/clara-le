Russian makes a distinction between ты, singular "you", and вы, plural "you" (you all). The latter also doubles for "polite" you, with verbs also in plural.

- Use ты with friends and your family members.
- Use вы with adult strangers, your teachers and in other formal interactions (at the store, the doctor's, the airport etc.).
- People use вы with those who are much older.
- Nobody is "polite" toward kids.
