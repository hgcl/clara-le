Russian has 6 cases: Nominative (subject), Accusative (direct object), Genitive ("of" something), Prepositional (place or topic), Dative (recipient, "indirect" object), Instrumental (means of action).

Some nouns of foreign origin are indeclinable, i.e. all their forms are the same. This includes words like метро, Дженни or кафе.
