A colloid is a mixture where dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. This two-phase mixture has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension).

An emulsion is a common colloid, where two or more liquids that are normally unmixable or unblendable (e.g. oil and water) are "merged" into a stabilized and homogeneous mixture. Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil dispersed into the water (a.k.a. the egg).

Other colloid examples:

- liquid dispersed in gas (liquid aerosol): fog, hairspray
- solid dispersed in gas (solid aerosol): smoke, ice cloud
- gas dispersed in liquid (foam): whipped cream
- liquid dispersed in liquid (emulsion): milk, mayonnaise, butter, hand cream, latex
- solid dispersed in liquid (sol): pigmented ink, sediment
- gas dispersed in solid (solid foam): aerogel, styrofoam
- liquid dispersed in solid (gel): agar, gelatin
- solid dispersed in solid (solid sol): cranberry glass
