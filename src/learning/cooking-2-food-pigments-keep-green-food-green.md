A group of molecules called chlorophyll is at the basis of photosynthesis. It enables plants to absorb light to power the plant. It also has a side effect: it gives the plant its green color.

Chlorophyll molecules aren't very stable molecules. They can break down or change configuration quite easily, which can change their color. Acidity, heat, and damage can also impact chlorophyll molecules, and thus the color of your green food.

### Blanching brightens your veggies

The chlorophyll is present _inside_ the plant, in its cells. When blanching, the gases trapped between the tissue's cell escape, the cell walls collapse and the chlorophyll becomes more visible.

Heat also plays a second role: it destroys a plant enzyme called chlorophyllase, which is responsible for breaking down the chlorophyll pigment into a brown color.

However, if vegetables are cooked too long, their bright green transforms into a dull olive gray. The prolonged heating causes the cells to release acids. These push out the magnesium atom in the center of the chlorophyll molecule, causing it to turn dull green.

When cooking, we should then avoid adding acids (e.g. lemon, vinegar) to blanching water. On the opposite, adding a pinch of baking soda can help retain some of the bright green color. Alkalines will indeed counteract the plant acids dulling effect.

Note: This is also the reason why lactic fermentation of green veggies will make their color duller.
