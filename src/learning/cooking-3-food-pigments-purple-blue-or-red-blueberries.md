Anthocyanins give their purple color to fruits and vegetables such as blueberries, pomegrenates, grapes or purple beans.

When cooking (heating), the anthocyanin pigment leaches out. Heat also destroys the pigment: as the purple color disappears, the green chlorophyll becomes more visible.

When the pH is high enough, as when making blueberry pie with lemon juice, the anthocyanins stabilyze into a red hue. When the pH is more alkaline, the hue will tend to be on the blue side.

Therefore, a dash of lemon juice or a pinch of baking soda can greatly alter the pigment of your dish!
