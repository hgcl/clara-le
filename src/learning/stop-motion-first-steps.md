Here are the learnings I have from my first [stop motion project](/posts/destination):

- Pay more attention to the little emotional gestures and details. Focus less on going from A to B and more on the little repetitive movements that make the object look alive.
- Be careful about not bumping the camera. Use tripod whenever possible.
- Make sure my body doesn't come in the light way and cause unexpected shadows.
- Think through the logistics for the complex moves first. _E.g. How am I going to make this jar gradually fall? It will avoid extra work remaking scenes._
- Make sure the camera focus is correct to avoid bluriness.
- For one viewpoint, simulate the whole sequence first to make sure the scene layout is right and everything is where it should be.
