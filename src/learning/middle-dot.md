Since I got back to writing in French in [Eau de poisson](https://eaudepoisson.com), I have started to use the middle dot more and more (for inclusive language).

I finally found a simple shortcut that works with my "French (US)" keyboard on Ubuntu: <kbd>Compose key</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd>
