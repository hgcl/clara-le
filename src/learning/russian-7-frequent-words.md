Not being super convinced by the Russian Duolingo course, I started through this Anki deck: [The Ultimate Guide to Russian â€“ The Most Used 5000 Words](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1147549038).

This is my first time using Anki, so let's see how it fares (or more like how I fare at it). I'll post some of the dumb mnemonics I think of on the way.
