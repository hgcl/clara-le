After about 1.5 year of traveling overland, Robin and I are now on our way back home. I am currently writing from Georgia, but it will be at least another month of trains, buses, and marshrutkas before we set foot home again.

After so long, new discoveries don't shine so bright anymore, everything starts to feel like routine. I am finally ready to be back in my own space (and kitchen!) again. Until then, I am trying to squeeze out as much as I can from these last few moments of _otherness_. --ENDCHAR--
