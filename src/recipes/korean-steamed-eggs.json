    "Tip 1: You can also consider substituting broth (beef broth, chicken broth, seafood broth, or vegetable broth) for the water in this recipe, which will give the eggs a different, robust flavor. This flavorful version is a nice choice when serving a steamed egg as part of lunch or dinner.",
    "Tip 2: For an side bit of flavor, swap some of the salt for soy sauce.",
    "Tip 3: For a nontraditional addition, top the cooked steamed egg with a sprinkling of cheese."
