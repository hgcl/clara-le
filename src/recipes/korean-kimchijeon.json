        "Pour the batter into the pan and spread it with the back of a spoon or a spatula to make a large circle.",
        "Cook until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "While the pancake is cooking, mix all the ingredients for the dipping sauce and set aside.",
        "Carefully turn the pancake over. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons oil around the edges of the skillet, then lift the pancake with a thin spatula to allow the oil to run underneath and tilt the pan to spread it evenly.",
        "Cook until the bottom of the pancake is light golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "Flip it one more time and cook for another minute.",
        "Slide onto a large serving platter and serve immediately."
