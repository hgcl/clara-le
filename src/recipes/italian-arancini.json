        "Spread the breadcrumbs in a plate or baking dish.",
        "Gently roll each ball first in the egg-flour-water-salt mixture, letting any excess drip off.",
        "Then roll them in the breadcrumbs until evenly coated.",
        "At this point, you can refrigerate your arancini for 20 to 30 minutes to let them firm up if they seem a bit too loose or liquidy. If not, you can go directly to frying.",
        "Heat about 5&nbsp;cm of neutral frying oil to 180&nbsp;Â°C.",
        "Fry your arancini in batches of just 2 to 3 at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pot until they are evenly golden brown, about 3 minutes.",
        "Transfer them to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain."
