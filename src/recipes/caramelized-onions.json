        "After 20 minutes, turn the heat to medium-high and add the white wine and balsamic vinegar. Cook for 2 minutes until the alcohol and acidity evaporate from the wine and vinegar, scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.",
        "Add honey and some pepper, then turn the heat down again, and cook for another 10 minutes, until the onions are soft and golden.",
        "Transfer to a glass jar. The caramelised onions can be used right away, and keep very well for up to a month in the fridge."
