        "Add butter to a heavy bottom deep pot and begin to melt on a medium flame.",
        "Butter melts and turns frothy. Then lower the flame & simmer until all of the froth evaporates. I usually leave a ladle/spoon in the pot as this prevents overflowing.",
        "Next butter will begin to bubble a lot. Stir it occasionally & continue to cook on a low heat.",
        "Soon the butter changes its color from yellow to clear golden. At this stage milk solids will settle at the bottom & begin to turn slightly light golden/brown. Also bubbles will reduce significantly indicating it is done. Be careful not to let it burn!",
        "Ghee will continue to cook on its own for another 1 to 2 mins since the pot is hot. By then the ghee is perfectly done – clear, golden in color and all the milk solids browned but not burnt.",
        "When the temperature comes down, place a strainer over a clean jar and filter it. Press down the brown solids with a spoon.",
        "Cool the ghee completely and cover it with a tight lid. Store at room temperature in a dry cabinet for upto 3 months or refrigerate for an year. Ghee will solidify in a few hours or days depending on the temperature."
