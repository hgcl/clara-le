        "Crush the garlic in the mortar with a pinch of salt to form a paste. Add almonds and beat and crush into a rough paste. Work in basil leaves and mint (if using), pounding and crushing into tiny bits. Smash in cheese, followed by tomatoes and olive oil. The final sauce should be a rough paste. Season with salt.",
        "Transfer 2/3 of the sauce to a large heatproof serving bowl.",
        "In a pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta until al dente. Transfer pasta to serving bowl, reserving some of the pasta-cooking water. Toss well, adding more olive oil and pasta-cooking water, one tablespoon at a time each, until a creamy sauce forms that's not dry but also not soupy. Season with salt, if needed. If the sauce gets too dry at any point, simply add more pasta-cooking water to loosen it.",
        "Serve, spooning remaining sauce on top of each portion and adding more cheese as desired."

    "Tip: Keep the sauce in the fridge and top the pasta with it before serving for the optimal hot and cold contrast."
