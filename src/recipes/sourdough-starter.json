        "In a clean jar, mix 20 g flour with 20 g water. Add a teaspoon of honey to give a little boost to your sourdough culture. Settle the lid back on the jar (without closing it), and keep it at room temperature.",
        "24 hours later, add 5 g flour and 5 g water, and mix thoroughly.",
        "Continue like that for a few more days, adding 5 g flour and 5 g water to the mix every 24 hours. At some point, you should see your sourdough culture start making bubbles, and/or smell slightly different than just wet flour (think vinegar/alcohol/banana smells).",
        "Your sourdough starter should be alive and ready to use after a few days — depending on temperature. Its smell should be vibrant, and it should bubble up nicely whenever you refresh it."

    "Add an elastic band around the jar at the mixture level to keep track of its evolution.",
    "If your sourdough culture seems slow to start, you can always remove a few spoonfuls from your existing mix before adding in the new flour and water."
