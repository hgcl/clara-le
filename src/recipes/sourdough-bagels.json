        "In a big bowl, stir together the sourdough starter, water, honey and salt with a spatula. Add the bread flour and use your hands to bring the ingredients together as best as possible. The dough will be very stiff. Knead the dough for 10 minutes. Cover the bowl and let rest at room temperature for 8–12 hours.",
        "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a ball. To shape the bagel, place a dough ball on the surface in front of you and use your thumb to poke a hole straight down through the middle of the dough. Pick the bagel dough up, gently shape the ring and place on the parchment paper. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Cover the dough with a towel and let rise for 30–60 minutes or until puffy.",
        "Preheat oven to 220&nbsp;°C. Put a large pot of water, at least 5 cm deep, to boil and add 1 tbsp of sugar. Once the bagel dough has finished rising, boil the dough, 3–4 pieces at a time, on both sides for 2 minutes, making sure not to crowd the pot.",
        "Use a mesh stain to remove the bagels and let rest on the parchment paper until cool enough to handle. Once cool enough, dip one side into your choice of toppings and place back onto the parchment paper.",
        "Bake the bagels at 220&nbsp;°C for 25–28 minutes or until golden brown."
