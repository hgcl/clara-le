        "Diced the cold butter into the salt and flour with a knife or dough scraper. Continue until the mixture looks crumbly and the butter pieces are around the size of peas.",
        "Make a well in the middle and pour in the ice cold water. Work it gradually until the mixture comes together into a ball. The dough should not be homogenous, we should still see the butter pieces.",
        "Turn the dough over a floured surface and shape it into a square. Roll out the dough into a rectangle that is twice as long as it is wide.",
        "Fold it in at each third lengthwise — like a letter. Rotate it 90 degree.",
        "Do a wallet fold and rotate it 90 degree.",
        "Repeat once more the last two steps.",
        "Cover the dough so that it doesn't dry and cool it in the fridge at least 30 minutes (or a few hours)."
