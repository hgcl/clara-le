        "Cook the chickpeas well (even canned chickpeas can use a quick simmer!) After soaking overnight, you can give the chickpeas a simmer in water for about 2 hours until well-cooked through and tender. Big tip! Overcooking the chickpeas just a bit gives you creamier hummus! So, even if you're using canned chickpeas, give them a brief 20 minute simmer so they will be well cooked and tender.",
        "Cover the cooked chickpeas in hot water and add 1 ½ teaspoon baking soda. Leave for a few minutes. Take a handful of chickpeas and rub under running water to remove the skins. Discard skins. Let the chickpeas cool completely before using.",
        "Dry the chickpeas well then add them to the bowl of a large food processor that's fitted with a blade. Run the processor until the chickpeas turn into a smooth powder-like paste.",
        "While the food processor is running, add 2 ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 minutes or so. Check, and if the consistency is too thick still, run processor and slowly add a little hot water. Blend until you reach desired silky smooth consistency. At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the hummus for an hour or so before serving.",
        "Spread in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of good side virgin olive oil."

  "notes": [
    "Note: If , for some reason, you ended up using more liquid than you should have or if you still want a thicker consistency, you can add a bit more tahini. And if you chill the hummus for an hour or so before adding any garnish, that should help as well. Another thing you can add to thicken your hummus is 1 or 2 tablespoons of Greek yogurt."
