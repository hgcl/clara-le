        "In a pan, heat plenty of butter/oil on medium-low.",
        "When the pan is hot enough, pour the potato mixture in the pan, flattening it slightly. It should hold together, but not be too compressed for an airy texture. Cook for about 10 minutes.",

        "Serve with a sunny side-up egg on top, and a salad on the side."
