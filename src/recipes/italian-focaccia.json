      "insSteps": [
        "Add 3 tsp of olive oil to the mix, and 1 tsp on your right hand fingers.",
        "While rotating the bowl with your left hand, fold in the dough from the outside (bottom) to the center (top) of the dough with your right hand. Do one full circle (or a bit more). Don't overdo it.",
        "Wait for at least 15 minutes before starting the next fold.",
        "Before folding, wet your hands and unstick the dough borders from the bowl. Delicately put two fingers (or hands) underneath the dough to bring it up in the air. Fold back the dough, bringing the extremity opposite you towards the middle, hiding it underneath. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees, and repeat the process. Do so until you have completed one full circle. The dough should feel bouncier and more elastic at the end of the fold.",
        "Repeat the two last steps (wait and fold) two more times. Be careful not to burst the gas bubbles.",
        "Wait 15 minutes after the last fold, and delicately make a bowl with the dough. Keep the dough \"opening\" at the bottom and put it in a greased mould. Let it rest for at least 15 minutes."

        "Using the tips of your fingers, make holes in your dough while spreading it. Be careful to preserve the gas bubbles.",

    "Topping 1: garlic, bacon, mushrooms, all stir-fried with olive oil until fragant",
    "Topping 2: sliced and boiled potatoes, rosemary, lots of grated cheese"
