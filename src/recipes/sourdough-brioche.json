        "Place a bowl on a scale, tare it, crack the eggs into it, then top up with milk until you have 145 grams. Whisk.",
        "Pour the flour, brown sugar, the starter, and the egg-milk mixture into the mixer bowl. Mix until homogenous.",
        "Add the salt, gradually add the butter and knead for another 10 minutes. The dough will remain sticky — this is normal. (Do not add more flour, even if the dough seems very soft; that's how it should be! The stickier the dough, the more airy and tender the crumb will be.)",
        "Gather the dough in the center of the bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 4 hours at room temperature to begin fermentation."

        "Gently cup the dough, pulling and twisting until it forms a tight skin with surface tension on the outside of the dough ball. Place the dough in a buttered baking tray, cover with a cloth and let rest for 5 hours at room temperature.",
        "Preheat the oven to 180 °C. Brush generously with the beaten yolk egg. Bake for 35–45 minutes, depending on your oven: the brioche should be golden brown."
