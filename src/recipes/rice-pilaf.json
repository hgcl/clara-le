        "Wash the rice very well a few times until the water is clear. You can let it soak in water for about 10 minutes or so while preparing the rest of the ingredients.",
        "While the rice is soaking, heat side virgin olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pan with a lid, and add 1 finely chopped yellow onion and 2 cloves minced garlic. After 3 to 5 minutes, the onion should have softened.",
        "Throw in the diced vegetables. Season with kosher salt and your spices. Cook until the vegetables have softened, which should take about 5 minutes.",
        "Drain the rice well and add it to the pan. Toss around to make sure the rice is well-coated with the spices. Pour in water. And season well with a big dash of kosher salt. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat to low. Cover and cook for 15 to 20 minutes until the rice is cooked through and has absorbed all the liquid.",
        "Let the rice pilaf sit, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. The steam will soften the rice further. Then, fluff up the rice gently with a fork, top with some chopped toasted nuts and dried fruit."
