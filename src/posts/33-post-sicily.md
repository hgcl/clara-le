Our first trip to Sicily came to an end yesterday, as we took a 13-hour ferry from Palermo (Sicily) to Cagliari (Sardinia). The two last weeks in Sicily were [full of discoveries](/posts/sicilian-notes). We are bringing back home some new recipes — _caponata, pasta alla Trapanese, panelle, pistacchio pesto_ — and also many bottles of local specialties[^1].

Another thing I am bringing back home is inspiration from people I've met and things I've seen on the way:

- Isabel and Baptiste, singing and dancing their hearts out during our roadtrip
- The rich sea flora / fauna that can be observed with a simple snorkeling mask
- Sicilians love for good produces
- Davide and his wife starting to make their own wine, honey and olive oil
- Those winemakers offering us a bottle of wine out of nowhere
- That little creative guide of Palermo, randomly found in a wine bar
- Georgia and Davide moving to the heart of Sicily to open their B&B for climbers
- Old ladies feeding stray cats in the street
- Alice, traveling alone through Italy with only a backpack and camping gears
- The close-knit community in Bosa (Sardinia)

Even though we will only be home in a few days[^2], it already feels like the end of a vacation. I am both anxious and excited to be back in our little Ardèche corner.

I am looking forward to seeing friends, climbing, cooking, and gardening again. I am however a bit anxious about being jobless _for real_ and having days full of _nothing planned_ for the first time in years. In the end, I guess it all comes down to taking responsibility for how I choose to spend my days and how I live my life.[^3] **ENDCHAR**

[^1]: alcoholic ones, that is
[^2]: We are crossing Sardinia to get a ferry to France in three days.
[^3]: Ugh, I definitely need to learn to take the pressure off.
