I love cooking. Or at least, I love experimenting with new things in the kitchen. As we have been traveling since December 2023, I miss my kitchen lab even more. (So many delicious discoveries that I would like to reproduce!)

I am reigning in my impatience and postponing these experiments to later. In the meantime, here is my ongoing travel cooking wishlist — updated as we go.

## Türkiye

- Ayran: cold savory yogurt-based beverage
- Barbunya: beans in tomato sauce (love the version with a lot of tomato paste for a richer result)
- Çig köfte: fresh bulgur-based wrap, great for summer

## Georgia

- Yakhni: beef stew with walnuts (the sauce!)
- Badrijani nigzvit: baked eggplants filled with walnuts and spices
- Pkhali: chopped and minced vegetables and combined with ground walnuts, vinegar, onions, garlic, and herbs
- Lobio: hearty red bean stew with walnuts, herbs and spices
- Chirbuli: similar to shakshuka but with walnuts
- Tkemali: sour plum sauce (great for grilled meat)

## Armenia

- Aveluk: wild sorrel salad
- Kharcho: beef, tomato and rice soup

## Azerbaijan

- Plov: one-pot saffron-flavored rice with dried fruits (made it in Baku and it came out amazing)
- Shirin chörek: sweet turmeric milk bread, crumbly biscuity texture
- Dovga: yoghurt soup with rice, chickpeas and herbs

## Central Asia

- Solyanka: thick and sour soup, with cured meats and pickles, originally Russian
- Kuksi: koryo-saram noodle soup that can be eaten hot or cold (super refreshing)
- Qurt: dried goat or sheep cheese balls, hard, salty and long-lasting
- Sesame honey bars: crunchy, nutty (perfect snack for long train rides)

## China

- La mian (拉面): hand-pulled noodles because yum
- Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐): super spicy silk tofu from the Sichuan region
- Laocang vinegar rice noodle (老仓米线): noodle soup with ground sesame and vinegar
- Tea: small tea pot that you refill with hot water and pour into another recipient to avoid steeping the leaves for too long (love the mindful process, perfect for conversation)

## Vietnam

- Chanh tuyết: ice blended lemonade with milk (add lemon zest for extra deliciousness)
- Cà phê muối: bitter black coffee topped with a thick layer of salted whipped cream
- Bánh cuốn: rice steamed rolls filled with meat and mushrooms (fav breakfast)
- Hủ tiếu: noodle soup with a sweet broth made from pork bones, onion, daikon, and dried shrimp
- Bún thịt nướng: refreshing bowl of rice noodle, grilled meat, sweet and sour carrots, cucumber, herbs (so easy to prep-ahead)
- Xôi: sticky rice served with sides, perfect for breakfast (love it with mung beans and peanuts)

## Malaysia

- Laksa: noodle soup with curry and fish
- Tea-based gelato: not my first tea-based ice cream, but Malays take it to another level (Matcha, Hojicha, Earl Grey, and many more!)
- Ayam masak merah: "red-cooked chicken", chicken braised in a sweet and spicy tomato sauce (amazing with cheese naan)
