I love cooking. Or at least, I love experimenting with new things in the kitchen. As we have been traveling since December 2023, I miss my kitchen lab even more. (So many delicious discoveries that I would like to reproduce!)

I am reigning in my impatience and postponing these experiments to later. In the meantime, here is my ongoing travel cooking wishlist — updated as we go.

## Türkiye

- Ayran: cold savory yogurt-based beverage
- Kuru fasulye: beans in tomato sauce (love the version with a lot of tomato paste for a richer result)
- Çig köfte: fresh bulgur-based wrap, great for summer

## Georgia

- Yakhni: beef stew with walnuts (the sauce!)
- Badrijani nigzvit: baked eggplants filled with walnuts and spices
- Pkhali: chopped and minced vegetables and combined with ground walnuts, vinegar, onions, garlic, and herbs
- Lobio: hearty red bean stew with walnuts, herbs and spices
- Chirbuli: similar to shakshuka but with walnuts
- Tkemali: sour plum sauce (great for grilled meat)

## Armenia

- Aveluk: wild sorrel salad
- Kharcho: beef, tomato and rice soup

## Azerbaijan

- Plov: one-pot saffron-flavored rice with dried fruits (made it in Baku and it came out amazing)
- Shirin chörek: sweet turmeric milk bread, crumbly biscuity texture
- Dovga: yoghurt soup with rice, chickpeas and herbs

## Central Asia

- Solyanka: thick and sour soup, with cured meats and pickles, originally Russian
- Kuksi: koryo-saram noodle soup that can be eaten hot or cold (super refreshing)
- Qurt: dried goat or sheep cheese balls, hard, salty and long-lasting
- Sesame honey bars: crunchy, nutty (perfect snack for long train rides)

## China

- La mian (拉面): hand-pulled noodles because yum
- Mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐): super spicy silk tofu from the Sichuan region
- Laocang vinegar rice noodle (老仓米线): noodle soup with ground sesame and vinegar
- Tea: small tea pot that you refill with hot water and pour into another recipient to avoid steeping the leaves for too long (love the mindful process, perfect for conversation)

## Vietnam

- Chanh tuyết: ice blended lemonade with milk (add lemon zest for extra deliciousness)
- Cà phê muối: bitter black coffee topped with a thick layer of salted whipped cream
- Bánh cuốn: rice steamed rolls filled with meat and mushrooms (fav breakfast)
- Hủ tiếu: noodle soup with a sweet broth made from pork bones, onion, daikon, and dried shrimp
- Bún thịt nướng: refreshing bowl of rice noodle, grilled meat, sweet and sour carrots, cucumber, herbs (so easy to prep-ahead)
- Xôi: sticky rice served with sides, perfect for breakfast (love it with mung beans and peanuts)

## Malaysia

- Sambal: a chili-based sauce that can be more or less hot/sour/sweet (great to accompany rice or meat)
- Laksa: sour noodle soup with curry and fish, never have I tasted a soup that is as _bold_ as laksa
- Tea-based gelato: not my first tea-based ice cream, but they take it here to another level (Matcha, Hojicha, Earl Grey, and many more!)
- Ayam masak merah: "red-cooked chicken", chicken braised in a sweet and spicy tomato sauce (amazing with cheese naan)
- Roti canai: this might be one of my favorite breakfasts in Malaysia, I love the chewiness of the bread and how it perfectly combines with a dal soup
- Kuih bingka ubi: I love these small bite-sized desserts, the bingka ubi version (baked tapioca with coconut milk) is by far my favorite, perfect with tea

## Thailand

- Tom kha gai (ต้มข่าไก่): spicy, sour, coconuty hot soup (and so easy to make if you get the ingredients!)
- Bua loi (บัวลอย): dessert of rice flour rolled into chewy small balls and cooked in sweet coconut milk, add some coconut ice cream for a great cold/hot contrast
- Perfect sunny-side-up egg: separate the white from the yolk, cook the white first and add the yolk close to the end (greatest egg ever)
- Laab (ลาบ): minced meat salad, love the Isan version that is more sour

## Cambodia

- Num banhchok (ំបញ្ចុក): lightly fermented rice noodles served in fish curry, better when topped with tons of fresh herbs (perfect summer noodle-dish)
- Amok trei (អាម៉ុកត្រី): steamed fish curry that has a mousse-like consistency
- Chha trob (ឆាត្រប់): chargrilled eggplants mixed with minced pork, deliciously charred flavor
- Coconut fish-sauce: a regular dip made with fish-sauce, but with an extra splash of coconut milk
