Still in China, now in Xiamen.

If everything goes well, we should be in Taiwan (yay, bubble teas!) in a bit less than a week to do a visa-run. We are getting a bit tired of the touristy sights and big attractions that _everyone_ seems to be recommending and queuing for. We are straying off towards smaller neighborhoods, and when we are lucky, we find these vibrant pockets of life.

## Hyperlinks

- [Terraform archive (VICE)](https://www.vice.com/en/tag/terraform/): Through the _Blood in the Machine_ newsletter, I discovered the amazing Terraform archive. This project has mandated and collected short stories from writers for one specific genre: speculative fiction.
- [Henry.codes](https://henry.codes/): Henry's personal website looks pretty incredible — very inspiring!
- [Transit Maps](https://transitmap.net/): if you are a transit map nerd, Cameron's blog is for you
- [Frontend Dogma's tools](https://frontenddogma.com/tools/): this might be the longest list of web-based frontend tools I've ever seen
- [368 chickens](https://368chickens.com/): spent way too much time on this game, 156 chickens remaining

## Media diet

- **Flyover Country** (short story by Tim Maughan, 2016): [Read it here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/flyover-country/). Very raw writing depicting a dystopian America — just wow.
- **Busy** (short story by Omar El Akkad, 2022): [Read it here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/busy-terraform-science-fiction/). Another dystopian view of the future. I love how comfortable El Akkad is with leaving questions unanswered.
- **Heretic** (movie by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, 2024): great premise, great actors, but getting worse with every twist, entertaining (and not too scary) overall

## Miscellaneous

- On April 9 was CSS Naked Day, and I participated for the first time [this year](/posts/css-naked-day/)!
- Added webmentions _once again_ to my website. Unfortunately, the platform I was using to host [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) (for regular comments) is not free anymore. Webmentions are great, but unfortunately not as inclusive (the barrier to entry is high).
- Discovered the `whereis` command on Linux, I feel so late to the game.

Until next time --ENDCHAR--
