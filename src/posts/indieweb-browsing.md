This weekend, I spent a lot of time jumping from site to site through the IndieWeb webring â€” [check my homepage footer to start browsing](/#webring).

I loved stumbling upon these little corners of the internet that people would customize to fit their own personality and preferences. A few of these websites were business-driven, but a lot of them were just quirky personal websites that you would never find through regular SEO.

Below is an unordered list of newly discovered websites that I liked for one reason or another. Either because it was just _so different_, or because it inspired me in some way.
