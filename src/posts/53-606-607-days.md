_Writing from Zagreb (Croatia), practically back home_

The last update was from months ago. So much happened since then! We left China, traveled some more in Georgia and Armenia, fell in love with Central Asia in summer, explored the Kurdish side of Türkiye, and here we are in Zagreb.

In the last week, we have been moving fast: a night train, a night bus, and a final night bus tonight that will bring us directly to... Switzerland.

It has been 606 days since we left for our trip in December 2023. In only one day, we'll be back where we started. 606/607 days completed — one left to go.

See you back home. --ENDCHAR--
