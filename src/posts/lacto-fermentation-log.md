This started as a log of my water kefir experiments. I am now broadening it to all things lacto-fermented (most recent at the top). The objective is to improve my process, updating my recipes and [fermentation learnings](/posts/fermentation-behind-the-scenes/) as I go.

## 2025-12-20: Kimchi

I have just made a batch of kimchi with my mother, and realized that the recipe I was following might be a bit too vague for her. I converted the quantities to be more precise.

While doing a bit of online research, I also realized that:

- Iodized salt might hinder the fermentation process — better use non iodized salt
- Light is actually harmful to the lactobacillus bacteria — a dark environment is important
- More salt will slow down the fermentation process, but also preserve the vegetables for longer — if the vegetables become too soft, it might be because there is not enough salt

## 2025-12-14: Curtido

We met with our fermentation friends to make a giant batch of spicy Salvadorian sauerkraut (_curtido_). One of them was very experimented, and gave us a basic recipe that could be used for any kind of vegetables:

- 1000 g vegetables (900 g cabbage, 100 g carrots — both thinly cut)
- 20 g salt (2% of vegetables)

For the curtido recipe specifically, we added some thinly sliced chili peppers, and oregano. Massaging everything together created enough water for the vegetables to be completely submerged. Wait for two weeks, taste.

## 2025-10-03: Water kefir

Changes in the process:

- Add 15 grapes to the 1.5 L bottle before the second fermentation

Feedback:

- In terms of taste, very similar to the original one. It is slightly smoother, with a tiny bit of grape aroma. However, the bright pink color is stunning — would try it again.

## 2025-09-24: Water kefir

Process:

- 24/09, 13:00, 22 °C: Mix everything
- 27/09, 18:40, 19 °C: Filter and bottle kefir, add a small glass of apple juice to the big 1 L bottle (lost some kefir on the way, bottles not as full as usual)
- 30/09, 16:30, 20 °C: Refrigerate

Feedback:

- The result is very dry and perfecly sparkling, with a hint of sweetness
- Go crazier with the aromas during the bottled fermentation. We didn't taste the apple juice that much.

## 2025-09-17: Water kefir

On the way back home, I stopped at my mother's place. It's been a few years she's had her kefir grains, and swear by this fermented drink. I love fermenting stuff, and kefir sounded like a low-effort culture to add to my bacteria farm.

I followed the recipe she gave me:

- 100 g kefir grains
- 100 g sugar
- A small handful of raisins
- 2 slices of lemon
- 1.5 L water

Log:

- 17/09, 14:00, 21 °C: Mix everything in a big jar, aerobic fermentation
- 20/09, 21:00, 23 °C: Sieve kefir grains, continue the secondary fermentation in flip-top bottles, drink is cloudy and taste is still sweet
- 23/09, 8:00, 20 °C: Store in the fridge, perfectly carbonated (not too much), still a tiny bit sweet

Things to try:

- Shorten the first fermentation from 3 to 2 days only, and see if it changes something.
- Add fruits and flavors for the secondary fermentation. --ENDCHAR--
