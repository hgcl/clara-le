I am currently [slow living](/posts/29-time-for-a-break/) in Ard√®che and spending my days following my heart desires.

Top of my mind at the moment:

- Climbing, climbing, climbing (and learning new cool outdoor techniques)
- Working on a private Pocket alternative with Robin
- Learning about plants
- Reading
- Tending to my website
- Gardening and preserving food
- Planning our big 2024 trip {end-key}
