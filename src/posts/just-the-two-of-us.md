Robin and I just realized that this is the first time in a month that we are back to being just the two of us.

It feels great to spend long stretches of time with friends and create a new sort of routine together.

However, the rhythm we are used to is also completely disrupted. We don't have as much time to talk or share the little things we usually do.

After some time, it feels right to get back to our own little world. {end-key}
