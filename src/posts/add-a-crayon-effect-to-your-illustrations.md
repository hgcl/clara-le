I love the cleanliness and flexibility of vector illustration. But sometimes, it just feels… _too perfect_. The grit and texture that come with raw sketches usually get lost translation.

Today, I'll show you how to easily bring your creations to life with a crayon effect, using Adobe Illustrator only.

Let's get started! 🚀

## Step 1

Open a copy of your original vector illustration in Adobe Illustrator. (Wouldn't want any accident happening, right? 😘)

## Step 2

Open the <code>Brushes</code> panel (<code>Window \> Brushes</code>) and check <code>Show Art Brushes</code> in the panel menu.

Select the stroke you would like to convert into a crayon line, scroll down the brushes and choose your favorite one. (So many brushes! 🖌)

## Step 3

In this example, I'd like to add a brush stroke around the face to define it better. To do so, begin by making a copy of the face shape layer (here called "skin").

With the layer selected, convert the shape into a stroke by swapping the Fill and Stroke swatches (<code>Shift + X</code>). You now have your outlining stroke! (Yaay 🎉)

Feel free to edit the color and line weight to see it better.

## Step 4 (Optional)

Let's say you don't want your newly created stroke to completely outline the face shape (because that would just look weird). Let's see how we can manage to have a clear hairline at the top with ✂

Use the <code>Scissors</code> tool (<kbd>C</kbd>) to cut two endpoints on your stroke to delete that unwanted upper stroke.

<figure>

✂ Select endpoint #1…

 <figcaption>
…and endpoint #2

</figure>
<figure>
 <img src="/public/img/20190430-crayon-effect-8.webp" alt="See? No more stroke!" />
 <figcaption>
See? No more stroke!
 </figcaption>
</figure>

Once you have your final stroke, convert it as previously done (Step 2) into a brush stroke.

## Step 5

Add some details to your illustration to bring it to life. Here, I've added definition to the hair and pink to the cheeks. And I got this flawless self-portrait as a result 💁‍♀️

<figure>

 <figcaption>
So flawless.

</figure>

## Step 6

Before celebrating the creation of your masterpiece, convert your entire illustration to an outline (<code>Object > Path > Outline Stroke</code>).

This will make sure that all the proportions stay the same, even if you scale your illustration up or down. (Yep, I'd rather stay the same size everywhere…)

And ta-da! 🎉
