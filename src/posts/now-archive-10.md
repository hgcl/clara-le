Robin and I are on a slow journey, having traveled from Europe to Asia overland. We are now taking a break in Hanoi (Vietnam), drinking cà phê muối and bia hơi, eating at street food stalls, becoming regulars in a local gym, practicing Vietnamese, catching up with blog posts for [Eau de poisson](https://eaudepoisson.com/), working on side projects. --ENDCHAR--
