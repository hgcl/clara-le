It's been a long time I had wanted to get a bit more familiar with digital drawing. I discovered the [Tayasui Sketches](https://tayasui.com/sketches/) software that was just what I needed: available on macOS, free to use, fast to learn, delivering great results out of the box.

Above is one of the first doodles I made using that tool! --ENDCHAR--
