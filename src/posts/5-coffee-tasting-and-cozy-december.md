## Life peek: Cozy December

Last Tuesday, something very special happened: December 1st. Robin and I were waiting for it for a long time as we could finally open our Coffee Advent Calendar from [19grams](https://19grams.coffee/en) — a Berlin-based coffee roastery. I am now excited to start every morning with a meditative coffee tasting session.

Besides that, this week definitely had some end-of-the-year vibes. I have been listening to a lot of chill classics: some jazz, soul and a bit of blues.

It actually feels so much like cozy December that I even started reflecting on the year — here is my [Year in Review 2020](https://www.notion.so/Year-in-Review-2020-f430491c0ec243128863b5fd59dcb295). I like Steve Schlafman's approach of spreading this reflection over two weeks. For once, it doesn't feel like an overwhelming chore.

## Read & Watched

### [Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me (book, 2019)](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL21194565W/Some_Kids_I_Taught_and_What_They_Taught_Me)

Kate Clanchy loves her students and you feel it. In this memoir, she invites you to meet some of them on a journey about passion, cultural bridges, pain and creativity. A moving and raw account of thirty years of teaching and learning. I am now going straight away to her new book _How to Grow Your Own Poem_.

### [How Technology Grows (article, 2018)](https://danwang.co/how-technology-grows/)

In this long-form article, Dan Wang denounces our fixation on the digital and computing industry when talking about technology. He explains the three forms technology can take — as tools, instructions or process knowledge. Very interesting read on the lure of the digital and what truly drives innovation.

### [Tasting RARE Russian Food in Karelia! (video, 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH6MynleTBE)

I've just discovered this Berlin-based food vlogger on YouTube and I already love his channel. I can't exactly say what I like about it. Maybe it's his long historical and contextual intros, the way he travels — that feels so close to mine — or maybe just his genuine love for food.

## Discovered

### [Hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/)

Was I talking about PaperSpan just last week? Well... Robin convinced me to upgrade to the next level of annotating tools: Hypothesis. Built on open-source technology and interoperable standards, you can highlight and annotate the web completely free of charge. Its development is transparent and collaborative through their public roadmap on GitHub. {end-key}
