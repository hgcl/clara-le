We have now been in Hanoi for almost two months. In less than a week, we'll get back on the road towards Malaysia.

For our stay here, we have been renting the cheapest flat we could find. Let's be honest: at first, we were doubtful. The place is practically falling apart; each piece of furniture is flimsy and flaky. Three things convinced us to rent that flat anyway:

1. A great accessible location
2. On a lively street full of amazing food options
3. At walking distance from multiple climbing gyms

All in all, it is surprising how fast you get used to a new routine. We are regulars at the bánh cuốn joint next door (whenever we wake up before they run out of food), have a list of our favorite coffee shops (has that ever NOT been the case?), go to the same bouldering gym several times a week (with friends!), cook at home...

## About the kitchen setup

The kitchen setup of our flat is VERY small and VERY limited. (No worry, I'll only complain a tiny bit.)

<aside>

### The kitchen complaint...

... or what's included in our kitchen for two?

- 2 very small bowls
- 1 big bowl
- 2 small glasses
- 1 coffee cup
- 2 small plates
- 2 forks
- 2 knives
- 3 tablespoons
- 1 kitchen knife (can we still call it a knife when it doesn't cut?)
- 1 cutting board
- 1 rice cooker (that's cool, love it)
- 1 microwave
- 2 small pots (one of them with a broken lid)
- 1 rusted pan (we asked for one)
- 1000 chopsticks (jk, just 4 pair of chopsticks)
- 1 electric stove (with a unique burner)
- 1 kettle

I admit that writing it down in a list format makes it seem like a full kitchen set. But try any kind of regular cooking in it, and you'll quickly run out of space and recipients. (Also, this is my article, so I will simply declare the kitchen as limited.)

</aside>

The kitchen limitations encouraged me to be more creative about the dishes I chose to make. My preference went to options that required little "cooking" and more "assembling."

Some of our go-tos[^1]:

- **Bún thịt nướng**: In a bowl, assemble rice noodles, pre-cooked meat from the market (or marinated tofu), lots of fresh herbs, carrots marinated in vinegar, a nước mắm based sauce, some peanuts.
- **One-pot rice cooker meal**: Add any types of diced veggies alongside rice, water, and seasoning to a rice cooker. Press the "cook" button and let the machine do the job!
- **Sushi/gimbap**: Prep the rice and fillings (choose whatever you prefer/have). Assemble, cut, and eat with soy sauce.
- **Kimchi jiggae and gyeran-jjim**: In a pot, cook the kimchi in its brine with some seasoning. Add the silk tofu to the pot and cook some more. In a bowl, mix eggs, water, and soy sauce. Cover and microwave for about ten minutes or until the eggs set. Serve both dishes alongside rice.
- **Homemade yogurt**: Scald 1 L of milk and wait for it to cool down (finger-in-the-milk 5 seconds test). Add the milk and end of a yogurt to a warm rice cooker. Mix well and let it rest (unplugged) for 9 hours.
- **Oats with bananas**: Eat the above yogurt with oats and sliced bananas for breakfast.
- **Fresh cheese**: Boil 1 L of milk and add 1–2 tbsp of white vinegar. Separate the curds from the water, add salt and compress.

At first, this kitchen seemed small and unfamiliar. With time, I learned to use whatever was available and even tried new recipes for the first time!

It's amazing how quickly a place can become home. I think I'll miss these broken pots and pan when we leave Hanoi.

Until then --ENDCHAR--
