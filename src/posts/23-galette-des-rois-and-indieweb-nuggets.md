## Life peek

Once Christmas and New Year are over, there is still one good thing left: _la galette des rois_, or the [king cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_cake#French_king_cake). We got a mini-one from one of our favorite bakeries, and Robin got the _f√®ve_ this time (a cute tiny porcelain cow).

As we are getting closer to our moving date, it feels like our days are packed with things to do and think of. Everything is also a lot more emotional. Each encounter with friends or trip to a well-known bar feels like it might be the last one.

_20 days left before the move_

## Read & Watched

### The lost city (2022)

<p class="label">By the Nee brothers</p>

So, as it often is, we were in the mood for a light and entertaining movie. <cite>The lost city</cite> was all of that, plus extra dumb as well. It was perfect. It stars Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum in a romantic comedy-adventure. The movie doesn't take itself seriously and is just what you need after a long day of work. Also, did you know that there are three series and three other movies called exactly <cite>The lost city</cite> as well?[^1]

### Aftersun (2022)

<p class="label">By Charlotte Wells</p>

On the other extreme of the spectrum, there is <cite>Aftersun</cite>. What a wonderful debut by director Charlotte Wells! There is so much to love in this movie. To begin with, the cast is incredible. The father-daughter relationship is beautifully depicted, the emotions are hinted at, without being shoved at you. The use of vintage camera imagery is brilliant. This is a movie you might want to rewatch to uncover all the details Wells left there for us.

## Discovered

I am not a hundred-pinned-tabs kind of person. I don't really know why, it just doesn't happen for me.[^2] These last few days, I consciously pinned websites I had stumbled on. If I like the process, this might be one of my new ways to nurture this _Discovered_ section.

[^2]: Maybe I get stressed out when having too many pinned tabs?

### [Blogroll by Ray](https://blogroll.org/)

<p class="label">On Ray's website</p>

I love how old websites used to have a blogroll page. For someone who had no digital life at that time, it feels like it might have been a wonderful way to browse the web. This blogroll page is just that. Ray's curated bookmarked links, shared with the world.

### [Cool things people do with their blogs](https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/04/cool-things-people-do-with-their-blogs/)

<p class="label">A Brain Baking's article</p>

I am not really sure how I stumbled upon this article anymore. I didn't know about _Brain Baking_ at all (and still haven't had time to explore it further), but I saw this specific article and really love the idea of it. Once again, it is a list, but a list of cool things people do with their personal blogs / websites.

### [Devils](https://devils.neocities.org/)

<p class="label">A Neocities personal website</p>

Talking about personal websites, I just love how different and original this one is! Actually, when you dive a bit more into the websites generated with [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), you'll realize most of them are super special and personal. Let's get away from marketing design and experiences when creating our own spaces on the internet!

### [Plot generator](https://words.bighugelabs.com/site/plot)

<p class="label">On Big Huge Thesaurus</p>

I was searching for a synonym and I discovered this website... 5 minutes ago. And what a delight to discover that they have a plot generator! The page basically generates new story ideas every time you reload it.

> A deranged pharmacist flies home.
