I am not sure what is happening to me, but since about a year, I get sick much more severely than before. A common cold can lead to exhaustion, strong headaches and nausea.

As it is happening more and more often, here is a list of the things I personally do to help me feel better (in no particular order).

## For the immune system

- Sleep, sleep, sleep
- Take some Vitamin C (e.g. oranges and broccoli)
- Drink herbal teas with honey and ginger
- Eat some rice porridge with tumeric[^1]
- To test: defrost and drink an [immunity shot](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/homemade-ginger-shots)

## For a sore throat

- Gargle salt water a few times a day
- Eat a teaspoon of honey
- Drink a few drops of propolis

## For a congested nose

- Take a hot shower
- Drink a lot of water throughout the day
- Do a steam bath[^2]
- Rinse nostrils with a neti pot a few times a day[^3]

## For nausea

- Controlled breathing[^4]
- Eat bland foods, avoid spicy or fatty foods
- To test: wrist acupressure to [point Neiguan (P-6)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDoQm8wxHg&t=25s)
- To test: candied ginger or fennel tea

## To prevent sinusitis

I have a sensitive nose that easily transforms an inoffensive cold into full-fledged sinusitis. Here are ways to prevent it:

- Rinse nostrils with a neti pot a few times a day[^3]
- Drink lots of water to keep the mucus thin
- Take a hot shower and do a steam bath[^2]
- Avoid dry environments
- Sleep with your head elevated
- Blow your nose gently, one nostril at a time. Forceful blowing can irritate the nasal passages and propel bacteria-laden mucus back up into your sinuses. {end-key}

[^2]: Essential oils: 1 drop lavender, 1 drop peppermint
[^3]: Preboil 3/4 cup water and let it cool down, mix in 1&nbsp;tsp salt and 1/2&nbsp;tsp baking soda. You can keep this solution for a week.
