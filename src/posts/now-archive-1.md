Now in Berlin for more than two years with my partner [Robin](https://robinmetral.com/).

Summer here is great: I am bouldering a lot, drinking orange wine on sunny terraces, trying not to kill the kids screaming in the backyard (not mine â€” neither the kids nor the backyard), [baking bread](/recipes/) and making half-baked resolutions.

But I spend most of my free time typing and clicking away on my laptop, working full-time as a graphic designer. --ENDCHAR--
