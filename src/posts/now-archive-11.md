Robin and I are on a slow journey, having traveled from Europe to Asia overland.

We are now exploring Malaysia through diverse Workaways and long quiet stays, two weeks at a time. We spend a lot of time in coffee shops, fleeing the heat and working on a big restructuring of our travel blog ([Eau de poisson](https://eaudepoisson.com/)).

Being slightly food-obsessed, we are happily discovering new dishes on a daily basis! With its Malay, Indian and Chinese communities, Malaysia's rich food scene is good to us. Favorites of the moment: roti canai, char kway teow, nasi kerabu kelantan, kuih seri muka. --ENDCHAR--
