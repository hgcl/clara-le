I have now been in Berlin for more than three years — kinda crazy.

My routine mostly consists of bouldering a few times a week, meeting with friends for morning pastries and working as a visual designer.

A few current side-projects:

- Nurturing my planner shop _[Life Under Control](https://www.etsy.com/shop/LifeUnderControl/)_
- Building my website from scratch — yes, _again_ — with [brut](https://github.com/robinmetral/brut/) **ENDCHAR**
