The other day, I stumbled upon the website of company XYZ. And once again, I got frustrated at their use of superlatives. So, I started a list of words.

Some words were included because they are too big, overused, overselling. Others, because they are often selling a behavior that I think is just a bit... off. All in all, it's just a list of terms that I grew suspicious of for various reasons.

- streamlining
- seamless
- AI
- personal branding
- mission
- pioneering
- SEO
- engagement / impressions
- smart \[insert object name\]
- terms and conditions
- productivity
- empowering
- self development
- environmental friendly
- zero waste
- carbon neutral / offsets
- sustainable growth

(This list is still WIP.) Anyway. **ENDCHAR**
