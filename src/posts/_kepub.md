Intro:

- goal: from HTML to ebook, clean conversion, keep a nice layout, pay attention to typography.
- searching aroung the internet, Percollate sounded like a simple and good option, creating an ePub file (with images!) from a URL
- Only issue with Percollate: the raw result left quite some bits of "dirty HTML" around
- Let's see how to produce a super clean ePub, using Percollate and Calibre
- prerequisites: Unix environment, Percollate, Calibre

## Percollate

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/percollate
- Run it: `npx percollate epub https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html -o "Wait But Why - The Fermi Paradox.epub"`
  - Fetches the page and strips unnecessary elements with `mozilla/readability`, keeps the hyperlinks
  - Generates an ePub with basic CSS
  - Adds the source URL to the top of the file

<!-- Å¦ODO can we create one ePub from multiple URLs? -->

<aside>

Note: I only use Percollate as it fetches all the post images for me. If the webpage you want to save doesn't have any images, you could manually copy your webpage HTML (with the browser Inspect tool), and go straight to the "Clean up the HTML" step.

</aside>

Limited by readability that retains quite a bit of useless HTML attributes or tags. If you don't mind a slightly dirty ePub, you could stop here. I am maniac enough to need to clean it up properly. My solution? HTML > Markdown > HTML

## Clean up the HTML

Open in Calibre, select everything that is under the `<body>` HTML wrapper.

- HTML to Markdown:
  - e.g. https://htmlmarkdown.com/
  - Clean up file
- Markdown to HTML
  - e.g. https://htmlmarkdown.com/markdown-to-html/
  - Copy the final HTML and paste it back into Calibre, under the initial `<body>` wrapper

This way, we don't lose the image links, while removing most (or all?) useless attributes or unnecessary HTML wrappers.

## Calibre edits

- Separate title page from rest of the text with the `Split` feature
- Quick manual check
- `Find and replace` recurring patterns
- Smart punctuation
- `Beautify`
- Replace the CSS stylesheet

## Metadata

- Edit metadata
- Add a cover
