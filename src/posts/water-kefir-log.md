Here is an ongoing log of my water kefir experiments (most recent at the top). The objective is to improve my process, updating my [basic recipe](/recipes/water-kefir/) as I go.

On the way back home, I stopped at my mother's place. It's been a few years she's had her kefir grains, and swear by this fermented drink. I love fermenting stuff, and kefir sounded like a low-effort culture to add to my bacteria farm.

I followed the recipe she gave me:

- 100 g kefir grains
- 100 g sugar
- A small handful of raisins
- 2 slices of lemon
- 1.5 L water

Log:

- 17/09, 14:00, 21 °C: Mix everything in a big jar, aerobic fermentation
- 20/09, 21:00, 23 °C: Sieve kefir grains, continue the secondary fermentation in flip-top bottles, drink is cloudy and taste is still sweet
- 23/09, 8:00, 20 °C: Store in the fridge, perfectly carbonated (not too much), still a tiny bit sweet

Things to try:

- Shorten the first fermentation from 3 to 2 days only, and see if it changes something.
- Add fruits and flavors for the secondary fermentation. --ENDCHAR--
