I haven't been super consistent with these updates for the past few weeks. One specific highlight since we got home: we went mushroom hunting for the first time with Cricri! When we came back, it had been raining for a week straight, so the chanterelles and ceps were just _waiting for us_ to be gathered.

Robin already wrote extensively about [our mushrooming adventures](https://robinmetral.com/notes/weeknote-14-part-2-mushrooming/), so I won't repeat it all here.

We also gathered a few of the vegetables from our garden — so green, so lush! It feels like every meal now contains a bit of our work in it: super satisfying.

## Read & Watched

- [The Road (2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road), a novel by Cormac McCarthy — Visiting the classics with this short postapocalyptic novel, that is focussed on the relationship between a boy and his father in this collapsing world.
- [Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons:_Honor_Among_Thieves), a movie directed by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley — Loved watching this after having played a few games!
- [Howl's Moving Castle (2004)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle_(film)>), a movie directed by Hayao Miyazaki — Rewatching it after years, I had forgotten how it was full of poetry and humour. It made me want to read the original novel soon!
- [Decision to leave (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_to_Leave), a movie directed by Park Chan-wook — Much more subtle than some of his previous movies. Striking photography, plot focussed on a forbidden love story (as usual).

## Experiments

### Swedish painting

We wanted to repaint the main door to our house, and discovered [this Swedish painting technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falu_red) through France. The paint is made by mixing flour, color pigments, iron oxides, linseed oil, and a bit of black soap. It can then be used as a regular outdoor paint, as it protects our wooden door against rain and deterioration.

### Getting creative with words

For a few years now, I have been writing on and off in my numerous diaries, travel journals, blogs, and so on. All of these projects are very down-to-earth, as I usually talk about lived experiences, current thoughts or future plans.

I have been trying to bring back some creativity in my life in different ways. One of them is playing more with words and poetry. I published [my first try at it in a previous post (in French)](/posts/dans-la-cabane/). I also tried to do some _caviardage_ exercises, that are quite fun and relaxing![^1] **ENDCHAR**

[^1]: In French, _caviarder_ means blacking out lines or sentences. You can do it creatively from a source text to create a poem, that has a completely different meaning.
