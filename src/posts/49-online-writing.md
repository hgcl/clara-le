In the last few months, I haven't written much on this blog. On the other hand, I have rarely written (online) so much in my entire life. Most of that writing activity goes into [Eau de poisson](https://eaudepoisson.com/), the travel blog we lovingly grow with Robin.

That's great, I love writing there. The only thing is that this tiny world is getting dusty in the meantime. So let's dedustify it following [Barry's advice](https://bjhess.com/posts/you-re-a-blogger-not-an-essayist): write anything I want, in any way I want, because _duh_ this is my website.

## Media diet

- Flow (movie by Gints Zilbalodis, 2024): wanted to love this so much, but just too anthropomorphic to my taste
- A Complete Unknown (movie by James Mangold, 2024): so Dylan was apparently a genius AND an ass
- Le Gala de Paul Mirabel (stand up comedy, 2021): entertaining and funny-ish, but no real made-me-laugh moments
- Dix jours avant la fin du monde (book by Manon Fargetton, 2021): French apocalyptic novel, thought it took itself too seriously

## Hyperlinks

I love the small web. I love how human it feels, especially in contrast with the big SEO/AI driven web of today.

Recently, as I was getting lost in the miasma of the internet, I just rediscovered some bloggers I like — what a breath of fresh air! Human beings, writing about normal human stuff, not trying to sell me anything!

There are more, but here are some that inspired me to get back to my own blog:

- [Tracy Durnell](https://tracydurnell.com/)
- [Barry Hess](https://bjhess.com/)
- [Roy Tang](https://roytang.net/)
- [Melanie Richards](https://melanie-richards.com/)
- [Annie Mueller](https://anniemueller.com/)

## Miscellaneous

- Discovered a new tree: the bombax.[^1] Its bright red flowers on leafless(!) trees really pop in the green/brown landscapes of North Vietnam.
- First time eating the Cao Bằng version of bánh cuốn. It is served with the usual rice steamed rolls, but also with an extra poached egg roll in a broth. (The broth entirely replaces the fish sauce in this version.) Good, but I prefer the classic version.

Until next time --ENDCHAR--

[^1]: I know, what a great name.
