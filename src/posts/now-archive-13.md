Robin and I are on a slow journey, traveling overland across Asia.

We are now on our second trip in China, a country that continues to surprise us at every turn. It is full of marvels, but also offers a number of dystopian discoveries. We struggle to wander off-tracks in a country that wants to keep us very much on track.

We are finally learning how to properly navigate these megacities without our usual digital aids. When we are lucky, we are able to find these vibrant pockets of life, far from the sanitized touristy attractions. --ENDCHAR--
